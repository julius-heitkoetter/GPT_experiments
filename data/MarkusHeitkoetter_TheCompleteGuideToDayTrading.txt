ay trading can be simple, but don’t make the mistake of think ing
that it’s easy.

I know that there are many websites and late-night infomercials that try
to tell you differently. They make you think that you just have to read a
few pages or attend an online class, and then, magically, you’ll become a
successful trader.
Don’t be fooled.
Like in any other profession, you need a solid education before you get
started. After all, the goal is to make more money than a lawyer or a
doctor, but many aspiring traders expect to learn everything they need to
know from an eBook that they might get somewhere on the Internet,
most likely for free. And how could a small amount of free information
teach you to make more money than people who have gone to school for
years and years?
Right, the answer is: it can’t.
Some aspiring traders think they don’t have to learn a single thing. They
believe that they can buy a “magic system” or “XXX software” that will
place their trades for them and make them rich while they sleep. Or they
rely on the advice of some “guru” for their trading decisions, blindly
following his recommendations without knowing anything about the
markets.
I’m glad you’re different.

VIII

Preface
You picked up this book because you’re serious about becoming a suc cessful day trader. And, by reading this book, that’s exactly what you’ll
learn how to do.
WARNING: Be aware, though, that just reading this book will NOT
automatically make you an instant millionaire. You’ll learn a lot of facts
and concepts about day trading, but in order to make the most out of this
book and become the trader you want to be, you’ll have to adapt the
ideas that you’re about to learn to what you already KNOW.
Socrates said that “Learning is remembering.”
And Richard Saul Wurman says:
“Facts in themselves don't solve the problem. Facts are only
meaningful as they relate to a concept you can grasp … New
ideas are not so much discovered as uncovered by moving from
what you already understand into the realm of what you would
like to understand.”
Source: Information Anxiety, by Richard Saul Wurman, 1989

Let me give you an example:
I moved from Germany to the U.S. in 2001, and one of my first “tasks”
here was buying a house. It should have been no problem – I mean, we
do have houses in Germany. It’s basically the same process, right?
Right – but where I come from, we measure in meters and kilometers.
So, you can just imagine my confusion when my realtor started describ ing lot sizes in quarter-acre, half-acre, etc. What the heck? How big is an
acre?
Of course, I didn’t want to ask – no one likes to seem ignorant – but I
looked it up. An acre is 43,560 square feet. Great. That didn’t really help
me. Now I knew the exact measurements, but I still couldn’t picture the
exact size of “an acre” in my head. I had no frame of reference.
But, I have it now. A friend of mine told me that an acre is about the size
of an American football field without the end zones.
IX

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Poof. Understanding. A frame of reference.
The same is true in trading. You might already know many of the con cepts presented in this book (e.g. that you should use a stop loss). And
there might be some concepts that are new to you (e.g. using a time-stop
when exiting a trade).
But don’t worry: I’ll present all of these concepts in a very practical way.
You’ll be getting a great deal of examples and scenarios to look at – this
entire book is about you getting that “grasp” on trading that you’ll need.
And by the last page, you’ll have it.
Remember Socrates: “Learning is remembering.”
My Objective: I am determined that this book will save you
both money and time when it comes to your trading goals.
I’m convinced that it will help you become the trader you
want to be.
Enjoy!

Introduction: Why Day
Trading?

I

f you’re thinking about getting into day trading, then you’ve proba bly got a pretty strong motivation. More often than not, that motiva tion is money. You want to be rich. No, wait. Let me be a little more
specific: you want to be wealthy.
Just to make sure that we’re on the same page, let me touch on the key
difference between being “rich” and being “wealthy:”



“Being rich” means that you have a lot of money.



“Being wealthy” means that you actually have time to enjoy
your money, time to do what you want to do when you want to
do it.

So, is day trading really the ultimate solution to becoming wealthy? Let’s
see.
Here's one way to become rich:
You work your way up to the position of an executive in a corporation
and make hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Of course, you’ll be
working at least 10 hours per day and at least 6 days per week.

XI

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Here are three ways to become wealthy:
1.) Starting Your Own Company or Internet Business
2.) Investing in Real Estate
3.) Day Trading
Option 1: Starting Your Own Company or Internet Business
Having your own company means that you’ll have to find or create a
product, market the product, sell the product, deliver the product to your
customers, and collect the payments.
These days, there are many “Internet Marketing Gurus” trying to sell you
on the idea that you can automate everything, which will allow you to
sleep late, do nothing, and cash very fat checks on a regular basis. We
both know that this is a dream, nothing more.
You can automate the routine, sure, but not the exceptions. And believe
me: there are always exceptions when dealing with people – your cus tomers. Plus, as long as you have computers involved, you need to keep
Murphy’s Law in mind: "Whatever can go wrong, WILL go wrong.”
Nothing could be truer!
Even if you could automate most of the delivery, you still have to find or
create a product, set up a website, write salescopy, put the automation in
place, and generate traffic. And since the Internet is evolving so quickly,
you will constantly have to update your website and traffic generation
methods.
Okay, so what if you skipped the Internet part? If you have a “physical”
business, the headache might be even bigger: employees, vendors, law yers, competitors, invoices, customers, production problems, office
space, equipment, etc. I’ve known a number of small business owners
who have simply given up and gotten a regular 9-5 job. Sometimes the
reward just isn’t worth the stressful lifestyle.

XII

Introduction: Why Day Trading?
Option 2: Investing In Real Estate
Our second option on the road to wealth is investing in real estate. But
with the market slowing down and the current credit crunch, it’s not that
easy anymore. Most lenders these days require a down payment of 1020% for investment properties, so you also need substantial capital to
even get into the business.
Another problem is the cost of a transaction. Whenever you buy or sell a
house, you will most likely have to pay a Realtor’s commission and face
closing costs. Because of these factors, it’s not easy to quickly buy and
sell houses. A transaction can last several days or several weeks. And on
top of that, you always have the possibility of problems with renters (if
you are renting out), or with contractors (if you are “fixin’ and flippin’”)
or with legal issues if you use those “creative techniques” that some of
the late night infomercials are promoting. It basically boils down to one
big pain in the neck!
You need an appraisal, too, and you might have to argue with the ap praiser about the value of the house; you need a home inspection and
might be surprised when you learn of all the things that need to be fixed
before you can sell; and, last but not least, your buyer might have to ob tain a mortgage. As you know, the mortgage industry has really become
“interesting” in 2007 (to say the least), and buyers that were pre-ap proved and pre-qualified might learn the day before closing that they
won’t receive the promised loan. And all of these problems are just the
tip of the iceberg. When it comes to hassle and problems, real estate in vesting is a flip of the coin, at best.
So, what’s left?

XIII

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Option 3: Day Trading
In my opinion, it’s the perfect way to become wealthy. Here are ten rea sons why:
1.) It’s the total “equal opportunity” job
Your race doesn’t matter. Your skin color doesn’t matter.
Your education doesn’t matter, whether you’re a Ph.D. or a
college drop-out. Your sex doesn’t matter. Your origin
doesn’t matter. Your age doesn’t matter. Your background
and history don’t matter. Even if you’ve been in jail for
years, you could still make money with trading. Your lan guage doesn’t matter. Your looks don’t matter. And your so cial status doesn’t matter, as long as you have sufficient
funds to trade.
2.) No employees to hire
You don’t have to hire any employees, which means you
don’t have to worry about job interviews, payroll, employee
evaluations, holidays, sick days, or employee performance.
Your only “team member” is your broker, and if he doesn’t
perform, there are 10 others waiting in line for your busi ness.
3.) No inventory, office space, or other equipment (besides
your phone and your computer)
You don’t have to buy or rent expensive office space, and
you don’t have to stock any products, which means you
don’t have to worry about expiration dates, damaged goods,
shipping, handling, insurance, or displays and promotions of
goods.
4.) No vendors, no customers, no invoices, and no accounts
receivable
You won’t have to deal with any face-to-face contact. You
don’t need any vendors, you don’t need to satisfy any cus tomers, you don’t need to provide any customer support, and
XIV

Introduction: Why Day Trading?
you don’t need to worry about any invoices, bounced checks,
fraudulent credit card charges, returns, or charge-backs.
5.) The time required is minimal
Whether you have a regular job or run your own business,
the chances are that you’re working at least 40 hours per
week. With day trading, you can trade either part-time or
full-time. You can start trading for as little as one hour per
week, or you can go for the maximum of 2 hours per day.
It’s your choice.
6.) Low capital requirement
You don’t need a lot of money to get started. This is not like
buying property, for example, where you’re on the hook for a
monthly mortgage and other cash-draining expenses. In
trading, you can start with as little as $1,000! (We’ll talk
about how a little later.)
7.) Returns are almost instantaneous
I'm talking "fast cash" in the sense that trading allows for
quick liquidation. You can convert trades for cash within
seconds. Where else in the world can you make money this
fast and comfortably? You can buy and sell and buy again in
minutes. You don’t have to wait to see your profits. Try this
with real estate or physical goods, where you might have to
wait weeks, or even months.
8.) Low transaction cost
You pay less than $10 per transaction in trading. Compare
that to real estate transactions, in which you have to pay sev eral thousand dollars in closing costs, not to mention a 3-6%
commission to your realtor.

XV

9.) It's simple to learn how to make money with day trading
You don’t have to go to college for years. And unlike most
other professions, years of experience are not necessary ei ther. After teaching hundreds of people how to make money
with day trading, I firmly believe that everybody can learn
how to become a successful trader.
10.)You don’t need much to get started
In fact, there are only six things that you DO need:
a.) A computer
b.) An Internet connection
c.) A charting software
d.) A broker
e.) A properly funded trading account
f.) A good trading strategy
I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture. Throughout this
book, we’re going to cover a lot of material that will help you get started
with trading successfully. Here are a few of the essentials:

How to Get the Most Out
of This Book

T

his book will help you become the trader you want to be, but it
won’t happen automatically. You will not instantly become suc cessful the minute you finish reading.

Making money with day trading IS possible, but it requires time, disci pline, effort, and commitment on your part.
Let me explain. Throughout the book, you’ll learn key concepts that you
can apply to your trading right away. The knowledge you accumulate is
extremely important, because it’s what you base your trading decisions
on, the decisions that will determine your ultimate success or failure.
One of my key goals in this book is to help you expand your trading
knowledge so that you can make well-informed decisions. I’ll provide
you with lots of valuable resources to help you learn what you need to
know.
At the end of each chapter, you’ll find ‘Action Items,’ exercises relating
to the topics recently covered. If you want to get the most out of this
book, take a few minutes to complete these Action Items. The results you
achieve will, in most cases, be directly proportional to the effort and
commitment you invest in creating them.
It is my pledge to help you become the best trader that you can be, but
I’ll need your help to do it.

Part 1:
Day Trading Basics –
What You Should Know

What Is Day Trading?

D

ay trading is the practice of buying and selling financial instru ments throughout the day. As the day progresses, prices will
rise and fall in value, creating both the opportunity for gain and
the possibility of loss.
At 10:15am, a day trader might buy 1,000 shares of Amazon.com’s
stocks just as the price begins to rise on good news, and then sell it at
10:25am, when it's up by $1 per share.

2

In this example, the day trader makes $1,000, minus commission. With
today's cheap commissions of $10 or less per trade, that's a quick $990 in
just 10 minutes!
When traded strategically, the trends and fluctuations in the markets al low for quick profits to be made in brief periods of time.
Keep in mind, however, that day trading is specifically designed to result
in smaller earnings on a regular basis; it is NOT designed to result in
huge fortunes through a single trade.
Day trading can be very profitable, but it isn’t a get-rich-quick scheme
(though many seminars convincingly sell it as such). Nor is day trading a
sure road to immeasurable wealth and success (as some hyped-up web sites would have you believe).
Quite simply, day trading is just like any other business venture: in order
to be successful at it, you need to have a PLAN. It would be very risky to
dive in head-first without looking. However, with the right tools – and
with the knowledge to use those tools efficiently and effectively – the
risks of day trading can be greatly reduced. With perseverance and com mitment, you CAN find trading success.

3

Who Should Be Day
Trading?

D

ay trading is not for everyone. Yes, there are many advantages,
but there are also some “negative” factors. One of them is that
you WILL face losses. As a trader, losses are part of our
business. If you can’t accept that fact, you simply shouldn’t trade.
And you need a PLAN:
Traders who enjoy the most success in day trading, regardless of whether
they’re in it for a living or for some extra income on the side, generally
have solid trading strategies and the discipline to stick to their trading
plan.
Keep in mind that day trading is a very competitive field. In order to suc ceed, you need to maintain focus on a set of strategies which you can
implement immediately, without hesitation. Remember, a proven, strate gic trading plan can give you an edge over the rest of the market.
Unfortunately, even with a tested, proven trading strategy, you are not
guaranteed trading success. It takes something else. It takes discipline.
A profitable strategy is useless without discipline. Successful day traders
must have the discipline to follow their system rigorously, because they
know that only trades which are indicated by that system have the high est probability of resulting in a profit.

4

Who Should Be Day Trading?
Whether you’re new to trading or have been trading for years, it’s all too
tempting to place the entirety of your trust in graphs, charts, and soft ware. If only trading was as easy as that!
Simply purchasing trading templates and computer programs does
not guarantee your success as a trader.
Too many hobby traders have tried that, and, unsurprisingly, they’ve
failed. They bought the tools, but they didn’t have the knowledge they
needed to succeed. As in all things, education will do wonders for the
aspiring – and experienced – trader.
Of course, this is not to say that software programs and markers are not
helpful when it comes to day trading. On the contrary, many traders use
technical indicators which are instrumental to their success – a few ex amples of these are the MACD, moving averages, and Stochastics. How ever, though profitable day traders DO follow their indicators, they are
also aware that nothing is 100% foolproof.
You will not get rich on just a single trade .
Successful traders know that trying to hit a lucrative home run on just
one trade is a sure way to get burned. The key is consistency . You need
to devise a solid strategy that produces consistent trading profits, and you
need to learn and adapt as your experience with day trading grows and
evolves.
If you want to succeed with trading, then you MUST invest both time
and money to acquire the knowledge that you need, the discipline to
follow your trading strategy, and the patience to wait for the “perfect
trade.”
You need the following mindset:

1.) Play Above the Line
Playing above the line means taking OWNERSHIP for every thing that’s happening in your trading. Rather than blaming,
making excuses, or denying that there’s a problem, be AC -

5

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
COUNTABLE for your trading decisions and actions, and take
RESPONSIBILITY for doing something about it.
There is no “bad market,” there’s just a “bad trading approach to
the market.” Nobody forces you to trade a certain market. If a
market becomes un-tradable, you can change to another market.
And you can change your trading approach and adjust your
trading plan. There are many things YOU can do. As a trader,
YOU are responsible for your trading results, nobody else.

2.) Have a Positive Attitude
Trading can be simple, but it is not easy. Along the line, you will
face losses, but you need to get up every single morning believ ing in you, your strategy, and WINNING. Have you ever heard
of “The Law of Attraction?” Basically, it states that in order to
achieve success, you need to focus and concentrate on attaining
that success. And the opposite applies too: if you focus on the
negative – on losses – then you’ll probably experience losses. It's
extremely important that you ARE positive and that you STAY
positive.

3.) Exercise Honesty
You overtraded this week? You let your emotions get the best of
you? You didn't stick to the strategy? Fine – these things happen
to the best of us. But don't lie to yourself, and don't make ex cuses. Take responsibility for your actions and your decisions.
Admit a mistake, learn from it, and move on.

4.) Be Committed
Trading success will not happen overnight. It requires commit ment, time, and effort on your part. There are already too many
“traders” in the market who think they know everything they
need to, who think they don’t have to learn anything; they be lieve a “magic system” will place their trades for them and make
them rich. You and I know that this is a sure path to failure.

6

Who Should Be Day Trading?
Trading is like every other profession: you learn the basics, you
apply them, you gain experience and then you refine your trad ing. The learning never stops. Do you really expect to make mil lions of dollars after only investing a few hours of time into your
education? You wouldn’t trust a doctor whose only education
was from free, downloaded Internet eBooks, would you?
There’s no doubt about it: day trading can be a profitable and exciting
way to earn money. With the right knowledge, you can radically reduce
the risk, which will create even more opportunities for achieving trading
success.
If you’re not willing to spend the time learning the techniques of trading,
reading about new and improved trading strategies, and working whole heartedly in a fast-paced trading environment, then day trading is proba bly not for you.
However, if you have the drive, dedication, and discipline, day trading
could seriously impact the shape and success of your financial future.
Action Items:
 Decide right now that you will have the discipline to follow your
plan, that you will play above the line in your trading, that you
will maintain a positive attitude, that you exercise honesty, and
that you are 100% committed to your trading success.
 Start a trading journal. Most successful traders have one. Get
your hands on a nice notebook and begin to record your trading
progress and your feelings every day. You can start now. Write
down today’s resolutions; you will NOT use day trading to get
rich quick. Circle it three times and read it frequently. It will
help, trust me.

Is It Really Possible to
Make a Living As a Day
Trader?

T

his question is asked over and over and over again by many, many
people. The answer is: “Yes, it is possible!”

And, better yet, you yourself can do it.
Sometimes people don’t believe me when I say that they can become
successful, full-time day traders, but it’s true. And I’m going to prove it
to you right now.
Trading for a Living
Before we get started, I need you to ask yourself one very important
question: “How much is ‘a living?’” Many people want to be ‘rich,’ but
they fail to quantify what ‘rich’ means to them. Are you ‘rich’ if you
have one million dollars?
Maybe so, but if you told Donald Trump that he had one million dollars
in his bank account, he’d wonder what had happened to the rest of his
money. He’d be furious!
One million dollars to Donald Trump equals broke!

8

Is It Really Possible to Make a Living As a Day Trader?
Over the past couple of years, I’ve taught hundreds of people how to
make money with day trading.
I’ve taught people in countries where $2,000 allows you to live like a
king in a 6,000 square foot mansion with a butler, a gardener, and a cook.
And I’ve taught people who live in California, where they have to make
at least $20,000 just to pay for their mortgage, their utility bills, and gas
for their cars.
I’ve taught musicians who wanted to make $5,000 per month, which is
twice as much as they have made throughout their whole career.
And I’ve taught business executives and successful business owners,
who needed at least $50,000 per month to maintain their current lifestyle.
As you can see, “making a living” is a very broad term.
Since I don’t want to get into a deep discussion about “how much money
is a decent living for you,” let’s just assume that you would be pretty
happy if you were making $150,000 per year, and let’s say that you are
making this money with your trading. Does that sound reasonable?
Let’s break it down: $150,000 per year would be $12,500 per month, or,
if you prefer, $3,000 per week. This is assuming that you are taking two
weeks of vacation per year.
IMPORTANT: Don’t set daily targets when you trade. In order to make
money, two conditions have to be met:
1.) YOU have to be ready to trade.
2.) THE MARKET must be ready to be traded.
There will be days when YOU are not at your best (sickness, emotional
stress, no time because of an emergency, etc.), and there will be days
when the market is not ready to be traded (e.g. holidays, including the
days before and after holidays, days before a major news release, like the
Federal announcement regarding interest rates or the unemployment re port, etc.).
9

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Take a look at the following chart. The markets were open the day after
Thanksgiving and on Dec 24 th and 26th, but there was barely anybody
trading, which you can see reflected in the volume bars. It’s the same
between the rest of the days after Christmas and through New Year’s Day
in 2008. Though the markets were open, the volume was very thin.
During these types of low-volume days, markets can be easily manipu lated and might behave very erratic, so it would be best to stay away
from trading.

And that’s why you shouldn’t set daily goals in your trading: those goals
will force you to trade on days when both of the previously mentioned
conditions – you AND the market being ready – are NOT met.
It’s important to start small and set a weekly goal for only ONE contract,
or 100 shares. This goal should be LOW, very low, so that it is easy for
you to reach it. Think about high-jumping: you train with a bar that’s
only three feet high. It’s easy to jump. Then, once you manage three feet,
you raise the bar another inch. And another. And another.

In order to trade successfully, you shouldn’t raise the bar too high too
fast. Put it at a level that you can manage every single time. You can al ways increase it at a later date, once you’ve proven that you can meet
your goal consistently.
Example:
In the first four weeks of your trading, you might set your weekly target
at $100 per contract. This might sound too easy for you, but keep in mind
that 90% of traders lose money in the markets. When you can make $100
per contract consistently, you can start “raising the bar.” Try $150 per
contract per week. Raise the bar again and again, but make sure that
you’re still comfortable in achieving your goals.
When day trading futures, options, or forex, you can use leverage and
trade multiple contracts on a rather small account. If you’re thinking
about trading the futures market, then you can easily find a broker who
will enable you to trade one contract of almost any futures instrument
that’s out there – E-mini S&P, E-mini Russell, currency futures, interest
rates, commodities, etc. – on a $2,000 account.
After awhile, you might raise the bar to $300 per contract per week. So,
if you want to make $3,000 per week, then you need to trade ten con tracts. The same applies to stock trading: if you can make $300 per week
trading 100 shares, then you need to trade 1,000 shares in order to make
$3,000 per week.
At this point, you might not have enough money in your trading account
to trade in these increments, but don’t worry – we’ll get there.
The key element to trading success is having a sound trading strategy
that produces consistent profits. If you can make money day trading one
contract or 100 shares of stock, then you can make money day trading
ten contracts or 1,000 shares of stock.
Ideally, to achieve your weekly goal, you’ll have a high average profit
per trade. The average profit should be at least 50% higher than your av erage loss, preferably even twice as high.

11

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
One of the strategies that I use and teach to my students calls for a profit
target of $300 per contract and a stop loss of $200 per contract. You’ll
notice that the profit target is greater than the stop loss. That’s the beauty
of it: all you need is one net winning trade, and you’ll have achieved
your weekly goal of making $300 per contract.
So if you’re lucky, you could achieve your weekly profit target on Mon day morning with the first trade.
But what if you lose?
As everyone in trading knows, losses are a part of the business, and you
can’t avoid them. If that’s something you have trouble accepting, then
you shouldn’t be trading. However, there’s a huge difference between
losing big on a regular basis and losing small in a controlled trading plan.
You already know that you should keep your losses small; the key is to
keep them smaller that your average wins.
Let’s go back to the scenario I mentioned before: you have a trading
strategy that produces $300 in profits for every win and costs you $200
for every loss. Now, if your weekly goal is $300, and if your first trade
was a loss of $200, then you need to make two winning trades to achieve
your weekly profit goal.
Let me take this a little farther and actually break it down for you: you’ve
lost $200 on your one losing trade, and then you make $600 on your two
winning trades ($300 each). Your net profit = $400. Goal achieved. Now,
STOP TRADING. Otherwise, you’ll end up giving back the money you
just made to the markets. Lock in your profits!
Of course, you’re not always guaranteed a week with only one loss. Let’s
look at a week that starts off with three losses. With three losses, you are
now down $600 ($200 each). So you would need to have three wins that
result in $900 ($300 each). Subtract the $600 you lost on the losing
trades from the $900 you won on the winning trades, and your resulting
net profit is $300. Goal achieved. Stop trading.
“Wait a minute – you’re saying that I will achieve my goals with a win ning percentage of only 50%?”

12

Is It Really Possible to Make a Living As a Day Trader?
YES! That’s exactly what I’m saying! Read the example above again:
you lost $600 on three losing trades, made $900 on three winning trades,
and came out with a net profit of $300. This means that you could pick a
losing trade every other time and STILL achieve your weekly profit
goals!
I want to stress this point again, because many traders neglect this im portant concept of setting weekly goals. They define daily goals, which
create an enormous psychological pressure, and then they trade markets
when they shouldn’t, and they lose.
So let’s just assume for a minute that you do end up achieving an actual
winning percentage of only 50%. Now, when you start trading again on
Monday morning, what are your chances of having a winning trade?
50%! You have a one in two chance of meeting your weekly profit goal
in just one, single trade!
So if you DO achieve your weekly profit goal on the first trade Monday
morning, what next?
Stop trading for that week! Just enjoy life! It doesn’t get any better than
that.
Remember, you need to stick to your trading plan and your weekly goal.
Do NOT enter into another trade once you’ve already achieved your
weekly goal; the chance that your second trade may be a losing trade is
too great, and you would be giving your money and profits back to the
market. Overtrading and greediness are a trader’s downfall, so resist
them and stick to your strategies.
Now, you know that you can achieve your weekly profit goal with a
winning percentage of only 50%. Throughout the course of this book, I
will help you to get an even sharper edge in your trading, creating a
trading strategy with an even higher winning percentage.
A Quick Recap:
The first step towards financial success is to define your weekly profit
target. Next, you need to find a reliable, straightforward trading strategy
that will help you achieve your profit goal. When you enter into a trade
13

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
and your trade hits either your profit target OR your stop loss, exit that
trade immediately. Stick to your trading plans and strategies until you
achieve your weekly profit goal, and then give yourself a rest until next
week.
If you’ll think back to the case I gave at the beginning of this section, in
order to make $150,000 per year – assuming a 50-week year and two
weeks of vacation – you’d need to make $3,000 per week. At a $300
profit per trade, this means that you would need to trade ten contracts (or
1,000 shares). Of course, this illustration can be applied to various
amounts. If you wanted to make $225,000 per year with a weekly profit
target of $300 per contract, for example, then you would have to trade 15
contracts (or 1,500 shares), and so on, and so on.
If you don’t have a trading account that let’s you trade the amount of
contracts or shares that I’m talking about yet, then now is the perfect
time to start building it. Remember, be patient with your trading, be
smart, be slow, and be steady. Trading success doesn’t happen overnight,
but with the right strategies and structure, you can achieve profitable re sults in a much shorter time period than you may have thought possible.
Plan your trades and trade your plan. THAT’S how successful traders
make money.
Action Items:
 Start your trading plan now. You will find a trading plan tem plate
in the appendix on page 245. Define how much money is
“making a living” for you. How much money do you want to
make with trading? Break down your overall goals into monthly
and weekly targets.

How to Get Started Define Your Goals and
Make a Plan

W

hen it comes to trading, many first time traders want to jump
right in with both feet. Unfortunately, very few of those trad ers are successful; successful trading requires knowledge,
skill and experience.
Before you dive in, you need to determine what your goals are. What do
you hope to achieve with your trading activities? Why do you want to
trade?











To buy a new sports car?
To buy a bigger house?
To make $100,000 a year / month / week?
To finance a college education for your children?
To make a full-time income to support your entire family?
Freedom to choose what, when, and who you do things with?
To have a fun, exciting life full of extraordinary experiences?
To work less and enjoy more time with your loved ones?
Or are you just planning to make some extra cash on weekends?

Before you trade a single penny, really think about what you hope to
achieve with that investment. Knowing what your goal is will help you
stay motivated when you’re facing a tough spell of trading, and it’ll help
you make smarter investment decisions along the way.

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
But be realistic:
Too often, people start day trading with dreams of becoming rich over night. I’m not going to say that it is impossible (because it is possible),
but let me remind you that it’s also very rare. It’s much safer to create a
trading strategy that will allow your account to grow at a slower pace
over time, which can ultimately be used for retirement or a child’s edu cation.
So let’s talk about how to define your goals and make a plan for your day
trading endeavors.
Here are the three important steps:
1.) Define Your SMART Goal
SMART is an acronym which stands for:







Specific
Measurable
Attractive
Realistic
Timeframe

Fortunately, when it comes to day trading, it’s very easy to define a goal
that meets all of these criteria. You simply specify exactly how much
money you would like to make per month with your day trading.
Example:
I want to make $10,000 per month with day trading.


Is this SPECIFIC? –



Yes, a dollar amount of $10,000 is very specific.
Is this MEASURABLE? –

16

How to Get Started - Define Your Goals and Make a Plan
Absolutely! Just check the balance of your trading account at the
beginning of the month and at the end of the month. Your ac count balance is the easiest way to measure the achievement of
your goal.


Is this ATTRACTIVE? –
That depends on you. $10,000 is definitely attractive for some one who currently makes $4,000 per month, but it wouldn’t be
attractive to someone who’s already paying $10,000 just in
mortgage payments for his 6,000 square foot home. Make sure
that YOU are motivated by this goal.



Is this REALISTIC? –
We talked about this in the previous chapter. Successful people
believe that there are no unrealistic goals; only unrealistic time frames. Right now, your trading account may not be big enough
for you to realistically trade enough shares or contracts to
achieve your long-term trading goal, but if you follow the steps
outlined in this book, it’s very possible that your long-term goal
WILL become realistic in the near future.



Does it have a TIMEFRAME? –
Of course it does: you want to make $10,000 per month; the
timeframe is 30 days.

2.) Make a Plan
Developing a plan is essential to your success, but we’re getting a little
ahead of ourselves. We’ll talk about your trading plan in detail in the
second part of the book, “Your Trading Strategy – The Cornerstone to
Your Trading Success.” Just make sure you don’t mix up the order: you
first define your trading goals, and then you develop a trading plan.

17

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Many traders look for a trading strategy first and then hope that the
trading strategy will help them achieve their goals. That’s putting the cart
in front of the horse.
Regardless of what you’re doing, you should first define WHAT you
want to accomplish, and then plan HOW to achieve that goal. Otherwise
you might find out that you started climbing up the wrong ladder right at
the very beginning.
3.) Execute the Plan
This is where the rubber meets the road. Once you have your plan, you’ll
need to actually execute it. And naturally, that’s where most of us fail.
Let me give you an example:
Amazon lists 18,361 books for “Weight Loss” and another 28,707 books
for “Exercising and Fitness.” That’s a total of 47,068 books on the
popular topic “How to Lose Weight” (compared to only 4,463 books in
the category “Stock Trading and Investing”).
If I wrote a book on weight loss, it would be a very, very short:
1.) Eat less.
2.) Exercise more.
Come on, it’s simple: we all know that we can lose 10 pounds in 10
weeks if we just follow those two rules.
We reduce our calorie intake to 1,500 or 2,000 calories per day, and then
we do some aerobic exercises at least three times a week for a minimum
of 30 minutes.
We have a SMART goal (“lose 10 pounds in 10 weeks”), and we have a
plan (“eat less and exercise more”), so why do we keep buying these
books and magazines that promise a new diet, a new way to lose weight?
Because we fail to execute our plan.

18

How to Get Started - Define Your Goals and Make a Plan
And then we blame the plan: “it’s too hard,” “it’s impossible,” “it doesn’t
work.” This isn’t true. We didn’t succeed because we were simply too
lazy, or we didn’t have the discipline to execute our plan. But instead of
working on the true problem – the execution – we change the plan itself,
hoping that there’s an easier way.
Successful people will realize that their problem doesn’t lie in the plan,
but in the execution.
Here’s what you can do in order to ensure your own motivation and dis cipline when it comes to executing your plan:
It’s important to focus on the big picture. It’ll help you stay motivated
when your learning reaches a plateau, or when you face a couple of
losses. All great accomplishments start with a great vision.
Once you’ve defined your SMART goal and the amount of money you
want to make with trading, ask yourself this: “How would achieving this
goal impact your family life?” and “how would it affect you personally?”
Take your time to answer these questions and write down the answers.
As you know, human beings are great at procrastination. We don’t like to
be outside of our comfort zone, and that’s why sometimes we do nothing
and just “hope” that we will achieve our goals. As you can imagine, the
chances of achieving a goal by doing nothing are slim to none. So, an swering the next question will help you to take action immediately.
Ask yourself: “Why should you act NOW?”
When you take the time to actually think about the answer, it will be a
huge motivator. Little tricks like this will help you stay focused on your
long-term goal, which will help you to execute your plan.

19

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Action Items:
 Continue your trading journal. Write down the reasons WHY
you want to trade and what you are trying to accomplish with
your trading. Be specific! Define your smart goals. Dream big.
 Write down the impact that your trading success will have on
YOUR life and the life of your family. This is an important step,
because it’ll help you get through the challenging times, which
all traders experience.

20

How Much Money Do
You Need to Get Started?

T

he answer to that question depends on the market you want to
trade. Using a systematic approach, we’ll determine the best
market for you over the course of the next few chapters, but the
information below will give you a basic idea of your options:



If you want to day trade stocks, then you need at least $25,000 in
your trading account.



If you want to day trade futures, then you should have between
$5,000 and $10,000 in your trading account.



When trading options, you should have between $1,000 and
$5,000 in your trading account.



If you’re thinking about trading forex, then you can start with as
little as $500 in your trading account.

Financial considerations are always important, but don’t make the com mon mistake of letting your current financial situation dictate which
market you’re going to trade.
Remember: you first define your goal, and then you plan how to achieve
it.
If you don’t have sufficient funds to trade the markets you’ve outlined in
your goals, then start doing something about it now – save more money
21

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
or put in overtime hours. There are a lot of ways to make a few more
bucks, and it’s better to wait for the funds you need than to begin trading
in a market that isn’t right for you and your goals.
For those of you who already have the right amount of money in your
savings account, let’s talk about the question, “How much money
SHOULD you trade?”
Many first-time traders think they should trade all of their savings. This
isn’t true! To determine how much money you should trade, you must
first determine how much you can actually afford to lose, and what your
financial goals are.
Let’s begin by determining how much of your savings should remain in
your savings account. It’s important to keep three to six months of living
expenses in a readily accessible savings account, so set that money aside,
and don’t trade it! You should never trade money that you may need
immediately. Unless you have funds from another source, such as a re cent inheritance, the remaining amount of money will probably be what
you currently have to trade with.
Take a good look at how much money you can currently afford to trade.
You don’t want other parts of your life to suffer when you tie your
money up in a trade, so make sure to consider what these savings were
originally for.
Next, determine how much you can add to your trading activities in the
future. If you are currently employed, you will continue to receive an
income, and you can plan to use a portion of that income to build your
investment portfolio over time.
Two more important things to remember:





As outlined above, certain types of investments require an initial
deposit amount to get started. This does not mean that you will
be risking the whole amount (see the chapter “Determining Your
Risk Tolerance” on page 27). Many traders are only willing to
risk 10% of the initial deposit.
Never borrow money to trade, and never use money that you
can’t afford to lose!
22

How Much Money Do You Need to Get Started?

Action Items:
 Take a financial inventory. Considering the points mentioned
above, define how much money you have to trade with right
now.
 If you don’t have enough money to start trading yet, make a plan
of how you will save or earn the money that you still need.
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 and fill in the amount
under “My Account Size.”

23

Determining Your Risk
Tolerance

E

ach individual has a risk tolerance that should not be ignored.
Any good broker or financial educator knows this, and they can
help you determine what your risk tolerance is and work with
you to find investments that do not exceed that risk tolerance.
Determining one’s risk tolerance involves several different things. First
off, you need to know how much money you have to invest, and what
your investment and financial goals are. (See the chapter “How to Get
Started – Define Your Goals and Make a Plan,” on page 17.)
For instance, if you plan on retiring in ten years, and you haven’t saved a
single penny yet, you’ll need to have a high risk tolerance, because you’ll
need to do some aggressive trading in order to reach your financial goal.
On the other side of the coin, if you’re in your early twenties and you
want to start investing for your retirement, your risk tolerance can be
low. You can afford to watch your money grow slowly over time.
Realize, of course, that your need for a high risk tolerance or your need
for a low risk tolerance really have no bearing on how you feel about
risk. Again, there is a lot in determining your tolerance.
For instance, if you entered a trade, and you see that trade go against
you, what would you do?

24

______________ Is It Really Possible to Make a Living As a Day Trader?
Let’s say you are facing a $100 loss. Would you sell out, or would you
stay in the trade? If you have a low tolerance for risk, you would want to
sell out. If you have a high tolerance, you would wait and see what hap pens.
This decision is not based on what your financial goals are. This toler ance is based on how you feel about your money.
And, of course, your account size plays a vital role in determining your
risk tolerance. If you have a $2,000 account, then a $1,000 loss might
make you nervous, since you are losing 50% of your capital.
But if your trading account size is $100,000, and you are facing a $1,000
loss, then you might be more relaxed, since it is only 1% of your ac count.
As you’ll learn, emotions are a very important factor in trading; there fore, it’s important to take the time to determine your risk tolerance. Talk
to a professional if needed. A good trading coach, financial advisor, or
broker should be able to help you determine the level of risk that you are
comfortable with.
Action Items:
 Determine your risk tolerance. If you’re unsure about how to go
about doing this, get in contact with my company, Rockwell
Trading®, and we’ll provide you with a set of questions that will
help you to determine your risk tolerance.
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 and fill in the amount
under “I Am Willing to Risk…”

25

What You Need to Begin
Trading

I n order to day trade, you’ll need:
1.) A computer
2.) An Internet connection
3.) A charting software
4.) A broker
5.) A properly funded trading account
6.) A good trading strategy
A Computer
You don’t need the latest computer, and you don’t need the most expen sive. Basically, any computer that you’ve purchased in the past two years
will do the trick. Most charting software and trading platforms run on
Windows, so if you’re thinking about getting a MAC, make sure that the
software you are considering is MAC compatible. Notebooks are fine,
too. Just as a guideline, here are the minimum specifications:








IBM or IBM compatible Pentium IV-class computer
1 GHz or greater
Windows 2000, Windows XP
256MB RAM (use 1GB of RAM when running Windows XP)
CD-ROM drive
Minimum of 3GB of hard disk space

26

What You Need to Begin Trading
You’ll also need a second screen. You should have your charting soft ware on ONE screen for the entry and exit signals, and your trading plat form on ANOTHER screen for entering the orders. A second monitor
will cost you around $150-$250. Don’t be cheap on monitors; you need
to make sure that you can see your charting software in crystal-clear
clarity. A 17” monitor will do the trick. A 19” is even better. Over 19” is
pretty much overkill. You can have a bigger monitor, but you don’t need
one.
An Internet Connection
Don’t be cheap here. Don’t ever try to trade using dial-up or a modem
connected to your phone. A reliable Internet connection is essential for
your trading success. After all, the data you receive from the market is
what you’ll base ALL of your trading decisions upon, so you can’t afford
a delay.
Invest in a DSL or cable connection. No T1 connection needed.
A Charting Software
Online day trading has developed to the point where charting software is
an indispensable tool of both professional and novice day traders alike.
The times when you drew your own charts in a notebook using quotes
from the morning newspaper are long gone. These days, powerful chart ing software packages allow you to access the market information in
real-time; this information is displayed in a variety of ways, all of which
can help you in carrying out your trades.
Choosing the “right” charting software is a very personal decision – it
can be compared to choosing the right car. What another trader chooses
may be different from what you choose, and vice versa. That’s why it’s
important for you to carefully evaluate a list of features – with both ad vantages and disadvantages – before you make a decision on a data feed
and charting package.

27

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The bottom line is that you need to have a list of criteria, and you need to
compare and contrast the available charting packages using that list.
Make your choice based on the results. Here are some examples of crite ria you may want to use:


Real-Time Data
You need a solid platform that can deliver real-time data in stantly. This feature alone will exclude many of the options
available, because a lot of web-based programs will have some
sort of delay. When it comes to day trading and/or swing trading,
you can’t afford to deal with a delay, even if that delay would be
perfectly acceptable in long-term trading.



Market Data Coverage
Check out the markets that are covered by the charting software.
Most packages include the major U.S. markets, but if you need
other international markets, like Asian or European markets, then
you need to make sure that data is available in real-time.



Wide Variety of Indicators
Depending on your individual needs, you might be interested in
a broad range of indicators and charting methods, such as bar
charts, point-and-figure charting, or Japanese candlesticks. In
addition, check to see if the charting software can display basic
indicators like MACD, RSI, and Moving Averages easily. If
you’re serious about technical analysis, make sure that you can
program your own indicators or modify the existing ones to your
needs without too much hassle.



Competitive Rates & Money Back Guarantee
You need trading software that will not cost you all of your
money before you even enter your first trade. It’s important to
shop around. However, finding a competitive rate does not mean
that the provider’s software is the cheapest. You have to be care ful on this one – the old saying “you get what you pay for” defi nitely applies when it comes to trading. Weigh your options. You
28

What You Need to Begin Trading
don’t want cheap trading software that offers you next to noth ing, but you probably don’t need the most expensive package –
with features you won’t even use – either.
And make sure that the provider you select will allow time for
you to test how the software platform actually works. If you’re
uncomfortable with using it, you should be able to claim a refund
within the first 30 days.


User Friendly Platform & Complete Training
Unless you’re a skilled computer programmer, you need to have
a platform that you can use easily, not one that requires a degree
as a Computer Engineer. Trust me, those types of platforms ARE
out there! You’ll need software that allows you to back-test
strategies and program custom indicators and trading systems
without a lot of trouble.
And, if you just can’t seem to find trading software out there that
is EASY to use, then find a software platform that comes with a
detailed user guide. A guide will help you become familiar with
the system and educate you at the same time.



Reputable Company
Choose a reputable company that has an established presence on
the Internet for its platform and data feed. And naturally, choose
a company that has excellent customer support service.
Keep in mind that you can add other criteria to this list based on
your trading goals, such as the ability to quickly switch between
different timeframes. As I said previously: it’s a very personal
choice that only you can make.

The following section includes my own personal reviews of a few major
software packages.

29

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
eSignal
(www.esignal.com)
eSignal is owned by Interactive Data Corporation, and it’s been around in
the trading industry for more than 20 years. In April 1999, it was
launched on the Internet.
As of February 2008, the prices for eSignal range from $125/month (for
eSignal Premier) to $195/month (for eSignal Premier Plus), which makes
this package slightly more expensive than a number of other trading plat forms out there. If you’re an options trader, you’ll have the capability to
see 1,000 symbols through an options analysis package. In other words,
you can expect to pay as much as $249 to $360 every month.
However, given that eSignal’s charting and data feeds are coming from
the same provider, there will be no issues that the software provider can
blame on the data feed, or vice versa. (This “blame game” is something
that every professional trader has – or will – experience at some point
while using trading software).
In my opinion, eSignal’s user interface is not the most intuitive available
on the market today; it’s often necessary for users to refer to the help
system over and over again. However, the charts can be customized in
many different ways, according to your needs, and once you get used to
the various shortcuts, the charting platform is actually pretty effective for
fast decision-making.
When it comes to a tutorial system, the company provides complete au dio and video training to new users. There’s no need to fear being a new bie – you can familiarize yourself with the software in no time.
Now, after you set up a chart in a way that you're comfortable with –
which is done by customizing sizes, colors, indicators, etc. – you can
save this format and apply it to other charts without delay. The sets of
charts and quote lists can be saved as ‘Pages,’ and it’s possible to switch
between these pages swiftly and easily.
Each and every window in the platform can be popped out of the main
eSignal window, which is a tremendous help when it comes to getting the
30

What You Need to Begin Trading
best out of that multi-monitor systems of yours. Besides the charts,
eSignal offers quote lists, level 2 screens, and news tickers to keep you
updated. All of these features can be connected to one another. For ex ample, picking a symbol in a quote list will make all of the linked charts,
level 2 screens, etc., change to the same symbol almost immediately.
All of the standard technical indicators are available, and there’s also a
program using JavaScript language called EFS (which is the foundation
language for eSignal Formula Script) for writing your own series of pro cedures; these procedures can be employed repeatedly all throughout the
life of the programs. EFS can also be used for communicating with bro ker interfaces, and, of course, for back-testing.
If you really want to get into a more advanced customization, there are a
couple of levels of API offered at additional cost, and these supply raw
access to the eSignal data feed. A standard subscription will let you
monitor up to 100 symbols, the next level up being 250, and if that’s not
enough, you can pay a little extra to get even more symbols to monitor.
The data feed itself is probably the best ingredient of the eSignal pack age. A trustworthy global market data feed, which eSignal has staked its

MetaStock
(www.metastock.com)
If you love using the technical analysis strategy, MetaStock, by Equis
International (Equis has been acquired by Reuters), might be your #1 tool
to trade. And, if you don't know anything about technical analysis, but
you’ve always wanted to apply this kind of approach when it comes to
your investments, then you might be interested in using this software as a
learning tool.
As of February 2008, MetaStock is available for a one-time fee of

33

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Many traders say that one of the best features in Metastock is the search
facility. The search facility will let you search your entire database of
stocks and shares based on your specified criteria. The plan is to uncover
any stocks that display according to your trading strategy. The program
will then calculate how much money you could make using a particular
trading strategy. The results will give you detailed information, such as
when to buy and sell at what price, and how much was made or lost from
each trade.
Equis will also give you a CD full of historical data from which you can
create charts, along with the online connection you need to upgrade the
database anytime you want. You’ll receive a 550-page manual of Tech nical Analysis, from A to Z, which will make even the novice trader able
to master the software and technical analysis methods in no time. Not to
mention that the ‘HELP’ menu even includes an interactive visual tuto rial, so you won’t get bored.

training, and a manual. Tradesense is the core feature of the Platinum
system, and you can learn it pretty fast. It combines common English and
simple math symbols for powerful analytics and crucial input.

Charting Software Conclusion
Hopefully you now have a better idea of what type of trading software
will best fulfill your needs. Remember, powerful charting software is
what gives you the velocity and ability to carry out nearly instantaneous
trades in response to breaking news. In time, you might want to move on
to more sophisticated software as you become more experienced in the
trading world.
Remember, don’t purchase trading software before you compare all of
the packages available. If you don’t take the time to compare and con trast, you may get sucked into cheap software that doesn’t have the func tions you need; OR, you may get suckered into expensive software which
has many features that you’ll never use.
If you need any help setting up your trading platform, or have any other
questions, you can always utilize the company’s customer support.
Take advantage of free trials and money-back guarantees. Remember,
selecting the right software for you is a very personal choice, and you
won’t know if it’s right for you until you test-drive it.
A Broker
You may wonder if you really need a broker. The answer is yes. If you
intend to day trade, then you must have a broker. And it doesn’t matter
whether you are trading stocks, futures, forex, or options: unless you are
a member of the exchange, you won’t be able to place your orders with out a broker.
Stock-, futures-, and options-brokers are required to pass different tests
in order to obtain their licenses. These tests ensure that the broker knows
his business and will be able to support you if needed.

36

What You Need to Begin Trading
It’s very important to understand the difference between a broker and a
market analyst. An analyst literally analyzes the stock or futures market,
predicting what it will or will not do, or how specific stocks or com modities might perform. A broker is there to follow your instructions to
either buy or sell, not to analyze the markets.
In most cases, brokers earn their money from commissions on sales.
When you instruct your broker to buy or sell, they earn a set percentage
of the transaction. Many brokers charge a flat ‘per transaction’ fee.
There are two types of brokers: full-service brokers and discount
brokers.
Full-service brokers can usually offer more types of investments, may
provide you with investment advice, and are usually paid in commis sions.
Discount brokers typically do not offer any advice or research; they just
do as you ask them to do, without all of the bells and whistles.
So, the biggest decision you must make when it come to brokers is
whether you want a full-service broker or a discount broker.
If you are new to investing, you may need to go with a full-service bro ker in order to ensure that you are making wise investments. They can
offer you the skills that you lack at this point. However, if you are al ready knowledgeable about the market you want to trade, then all you
really need is a discount broker to make your trades for you.
Selecting the right broker can be a tedious battle for most novice traders.
There are more than a hundred online brokers today and additional
choices are becoming available all the time.
The challenge lies with too many choices – it isn’t easy to choose which
broker is best for you amongst all of the many options out there.
This section, though, is all about providing you with some necessary tips
for picking an ideal trading broker.

37

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
First off, you’ll need to double your diligence if you’re looking for a
forex trading broker. Since the foreign exchange market is worth trillions
of dollars, it offers lucrative opportunities for brokers to set up their firms
online. And since the foreign exchange market is decentralized, it can be
hard to identify quality brokers amongst all of the unscrupulous brokers
with fraudulent practices.
Your chances of finding an honest and reliable forex trading broker will
dramatically increase if you follow the guidelines below:


Always request references that you can actually speak with.



Do a check with the local regulatory agencies and make sure that
the forex trading broker is registered. For U.S.-based brokers,
see if they are registered as Futures Commission Merchants
(FCM) with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC), and registered with the National Futures Association
(NFA).



Compare the account details, such as the minimum deposit re quired, leverage, spreads, and so on. Ask them specifically if
commissions are chargeable, lot fees, etc. This is to ensure that
you do not incur hidden costs. Some sneaky brokers will deliber ately give you an impression that they are the cheapest to use,
but in actual fact, they’ll hit you where it hurts when it comes to
hidden charges.



The trading platform needs to be user-friendly. Many traders,
especially first-timers, find it challenging to navigate trading
software. Just making sense of the charts and currency prices can
be a challenge. So, if there are demo accounts, try them.

I’ve also included a list of questions for you to ask your broker in the
appendices.
Remember, this broker or brokerage is going to be your teammate when
it comes to making you a wealthy person. So be picky and be cautious.

38

What You Need to Begin Trading
A Properly Funded Trading Account
Obviously, you need money to trade. But you’ve also heard this warning
several times: “Don’t trade with money that you can’t afford to lose.”
You might think that this is just the typical disclaimer that every profes sional in the trading industry has to use. But it’s not. It’s much more.
Let me give you an example:
A few weeks ago, I received an email from a trader who told me that his
wife had given him a deadline: if he was not trading profitably within the
next four weeks, he would have to stop trading altogether and get a ‘real
job.’
I’m not saying that this trader’s wife didn’t have ground to stand on, but,
as you’ll learn in the third part of this book, there’s more to trading than
just having a strategy. You might have heard that a trader’s two biggest
enemies are fear and greed. This is very often the case. That’s why con trolling your emotions is extremely important to your trading.
Now, imagine this trader’s situation for me. He MUST be profitable
every single week for the next four weeks. Do you think he will be cool
and relaxed when he enters a trade? Do you think he will be in control of
his emotions? If he loses a few trades, do you think he’ll stick to his
trading strategy and plan?
Or do you think he’ll be afraid of losing money, which means having to
give up what he LOVES to do? It will probably be hard to stick to a plan
or strategy if he’s getting hit with more and more losses. Don’t you think
it’s pretty likely that he’ll start making bad decisions and begin, in es sence, to gamble his money in the markets, hoping for wins?
I can’t stress enough how important it is not to put too much pressure on
yourself or your trading performance. And in order to keep the pressure
to a minimum, you probably shouldn’t quit your day job just yet. Before
becoming a professional day trader, your trading must be consistent, and
your profits should be almost predictable. Give yourself some time to
prove that you have what it takes to trade for a living.

39

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
As to the amount of money you actually need, that depends on you.
Having too much money in your trading account can be just as dangerous
as having too little. If you have $100,000 in your trading account and
only risk $100 per trade, you might think of your losses as ‘peanuts.’
Even though we must learn to accept losses as a part of the business, we
should still never think of them as ‘peanuts!’ There is a balance. You
have to find it.
So, in order to avoid situations like the afore-mentioned trader got him self into, fund your account appropriately – not too much and not too
little. And be prepared for a period of time where you may not make a lot
of money with it. As with everything, there is a learning process when it
comes to trading.
For more information on the right amount of money to get started with,
see the chapter “How Much Money Do You Need to Get Started?” on
page 23.
A Trading Strategy
Last, but definitely not least: you need a trading strategy.
You can have the latest computer, six screens, a T1-Internet connection,
the best broker in the world, and a well-funded trading account, but none
of these will produce trading profits for you.
NEVER start trading without a trading strategy.
In the next part of this book, you’ll learn how to develop a profitable
trading strategy that works for you.

40

What You Need to Begin Trading
Action Items:
 Check your computer to see if it fulfills the minimum require ments outlined in this chapter. If not, determine how much it will
cost to upgrade your computer. You do not have to upgrade your
computer – or buy a new one – now, but you should know the
cost if you’re getting ready to trade.
 Check your current Internet connection and determine the cost
for an upgrade if needed. Same as with the other trading ele ments: there’s no need to upgrade now, but you’ll want to know
the cost once you start your trading business.
 Take a look at different charting software packages. Most of
them offer a free 30-day trial. Get familiar with the software and
make a decision based on the “ease of use” of the software, NOT
on the price. You’ll work with this software almost every day, so
it’s important to choose one that fits YOU best. When you start
your trading career, you don’t want to spend a lot of time learn ing the software. It should be intuitive and easy-to-use.
 Start calling several brokers to obtain quotes. The brokerage
business is highly competitive, so you need to shop around for
the best commission. But, as outlined above: do NOT base your
decision purely on commissions. Your broker is your only team
member, and you want to have a team member who you trust and
who knows you. Try to find a “personal broker” who has a direct
line and doesn’t “hide” in a call center. Ask him what he can
offer you. After a few calls you will get the feeling of a “good”
broker.

eveloping a profitable trading strategy is not as complicated as
you might be led to believe. Many people will tell you that it’s
extremely difficult to build your own trading system, but it’s
actually pretty straightforward.
The next part of this book will show you how to develop your own trad ing strategy in seven simple, but very important, steps.
Step 1: Selecting a Market
Step 2: Selecting a Timeframe
Step 3: Selecting a Trading Style
Step 4: Defining Entry Points
Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Step 6: Evaluating Your Trading Strategy
Step 7: Improving Your Trading Strategy

44

Step 1: Selecting a Market

W

ith the fame of online trading, more and more financial in struments are available to trade. You have a variety of
choices, not just stocks, options, and futures. In recent years,
financial instruments like Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), Single Stock
Futures (SSF), and the Foreign Exchange Market (forex) have become
available for the private investor.
In addition, the existing financial instruments have been enhanced. Ex changes started introducing electronic contracts and mini contracts of
popular commodities like gold, silver, crude oil, natural gas, and grains.
These futures contracts have become very popular amongst day traders,
and the volume of the mini and electronic contracts quickly surpassed the
volume of the pit-traded commodities.
These days, you can basically trade ANYTHING. For example, if you
want to participate in the real estate market without owning properties,
you can invest in Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), or even Real
Estate Futures of a particular area, like Chicago or Denver (traded at the
CME).
In this chapter, we’ll focus on the four main markets: stocks, forex, fu tures, and stock options. We’ll examine each of these markets according
to the following criteria:
1.) Low Initial Capital Requirements
Low initial capital means that you can start your day trading
activities with a low initial deposit. It’s always better to trade

45

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
with small capital and then move up to larger capital when
you’re comfortable enough with the market.
2.) Leverage
Leverage is the second key. With sound risk management in
place, highly leveraged markets allow us to place a small
amount of capital into the market and realize larger profit
potentials. This will enable us to build up a small account
quickly.
3.) Liquidity
The third factor is liquidity. We’ll focus on liquid markets to
avoid problems caused by market manipulation and slippage.
When trading a market, we want to ensure that we receive
quick and accurate fills for our orders, and also that a large
order placed by a market-maker or broker does not move the
market in an erratic way.
4.) Volatility
The fourth factor is volatility. You can make money in any
market, as long as it’s moving. A market that’s just going
sideways and doesn’t move in any direction is extremely dif ficult to trade. It’s easier to trade a market that’s either going
up or going down.
Throughout the course of this book, you’ll learn how to trade any market,
but it certainly helps to know something about the market you’re trading.
So, we’ll include a brief description of markets and participants in the
beginning of each of the following sections.
Trading Stocks
The stock market is a private or public market for the trading of company
stock at an agreed price. Companies are given a value by investors. The
value of the company is divided into many shares. These shares can be
bought or sold (raising or lowering the value of the company).
46

Step 1: Selecting a Market
When you buy stocks, you essentially own a little piece of that company
whose shares you just bought. You’ll become a shareholder. So, the more
shares you buy, the larger the portion of the company you own. If the
value of the company rises, the value of your shares rises. If the value of
the company decreases, the value of your shares decreases.
When the company makes a profit, you may receive some of that profit
in the form of dividends; the profit is shared amongst all the people who
own the stock.
Ownership of shares is normally called equity.
There are two main types of stocks – preferred stock and common
stock – and there are many advantages to owning preferred stock over
common stock. Here are the main ones:
1. When you’re holding a preferred stock, then the dividend is paid
to you before any dividends are paid to common stock holders.
2. A preferred stock typically pays a fixed dividend that does not
fluctuate, unlike the dividend of a common stock.
3. Owners of preferred stocks have a greater claim on the com pany’s assets. For example, in case of bankruptcy, preferred
stock holders are paid first, before common stock holders.
However, as a day trader, you really don’t have to worry about the dif ferent kinds of stocks or dividend yields, since you’re just holding a
stock for a few minutes or hours.
Avoiding Stock Trading Scams
If you have an email account, then you’ve probably received a great deal
of emails with Free Stock Trading Tips. In these emails, somebody rec ommends a “hot stock.”
If you were to follow these tips, you’d probably end up getting caught in
a so-called "pump-and-dump" scheme.

47

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Here's how it works:
These so-called stock picking services buy a certain stock that's usually
trading at $0.02-$0.30. Many times, these stocks are not even listed on
the exchanges, and the volume is typically only a few thousand shares
per day.
After these stock picking services buy tens of thousands of these shares,
they start recommending it to their subscribers. You’ll find that it’s not
easy to buy these stocks since they’re not listed on regular stock ex changes. And, if you ask your broker to buy this stock for you, you might
end up paying 4-5 times more than normal in commissions.
The stock picking service is now hoping that many of their subscribers
will start buying this stock. They typically say, "It's trading now at $0.02
and it should go up to $0.12.” That would be a whopping 600% increase!
Since stock traders are greedy by nature, many will probably start buying
this stock, and since there is a sudden demand, the stock prices will go up
– initially.
But, before the stock hits the predicted exit price, the stock picking ser vice starts selling (or dumping) the shares that they bought BEFORE
they recommended it to you.
Since they bought such a large amount of this stock, there's suddenly an
enormous supply available again, and prices start falling. More and more
investors panic and sell their stocks, which drives the stock prices even
further down.
After a massive sell-off, the stock is generally trading at the same level it
was BEFORE the stock picking service started recommending it. And, in
some cases, it’ll be much lower, resulting in a loss for whoever was
drawn into the trap. So, investors are losing their money, and the only
winner is the stock picking service.
Here’s an example of a “pump-and-dump” scheme:
The following image is a screenshot from an online service that is offer ing “Free Stock Tips.”

48

Step 1: Selecting a Market

As you can see, they’re recommending that you buy MOSH on
12/18/2007. Let’s take a look at the chart for this stock:

(Dates are displayed along the bottom of the chart)

As you can see, stock prices start moving two days before the “hot tip”
at unusually high volume. If you were to buy MOSH on Dec 18 th, 2007,
at the point of the arrow, as recommended by this service, you would
have bought it at a price between $0.25 and $0.35 per share.
Note that a few days later, the “hot stock pick” is trading at $0.20, and
you would have lost between 25-75% of your capital.
49

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Let’s check the stock market against our criteria:
1.) Capital Requirements
In August and September of 2001, the NYSE and NASD
established the Pattern Day Trading Rule. This rule dictates
that “if a trader executes four or more day trades within a
five-business-day period then he must maintain a minimum
equity of $25,000 in his margin account at all times.” This
means that you need at least $28,000-$30,000 if you want to
day trade stocks, because you need a “cushion” if you ex perience losses.
2.) Leverage
When trading stocks, you can either open a “cash account”
or a “margin account.” When you open a cash account, you
can buy or sell stock for exactly the amount you have in your
account – i.e. your leverage is 1:1.
When you open a margin account, you can trade stocks on
margin. Buying on margin is borrowing money from a broker to purchase stock. You can think of it as a loan from your
brokerage. Margin trading allows you to buy more stock than
you'd be able to normally. An initial investment of at least
$2,000 is required for a margin account, though some
brokerages require more. This deposit is known as the
minimum margin. Once the account is opened and opera tional, you can borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of a
stock.
Example: Let's say that you deposit $10,000 in your margin
account. Because you put up 50% of the purchase price, this
means you have $20,000 worth of buying power. Then, if
you buy $5,000 worth of stock, you still have $15,000 in
buying power remaining. In this case your leverage is 1:2.
If you have developed a good relationship with your broker,
he might even allow you to borrow up to 80% of your initial
deposit, giving you a leverage of 1:8.
50

Step 1: Selecting a Market
3.) Liquidity
Currently there are more than 10,000 stocks available on
U.S. stock exchanges. Around 900 stocks have an average
daily volume of more than 2,000,000 shares traded, and
more than 600 of them are traded with over 3,000,000 shares
per day. If you focus on these stocks then you won’t have a
problem with market manipulation or slippage.
4.) Volatility
In 2007, the average daily movement of the stocks in the
Dow Jones Index was between 1% and 2%, and many of
these stocks moved even more dramatically than that:
-

Alcoa, Inc. (AA) moved between 2% and 5% per day

-

American Intl. Group (AIG) moved between 2% and 8%
per day

-

American Express (AXP) moved between 2% and 6%
per day

And that’s just naming the first three stocks of the Dow
Jones. Volatility has NOT been a problem in the stock mar kets, especially in 2007.
Conclusion:
Stock markets have good liquidity and volatility, but the initial capital
requirements are high ($25,000) and the maximum leverage is only 1:8.
Trading Forex
This market may sound really complicated and frightening to tackle, but
trust me, it’s not. Just like any other type of trading, the basic rule in the
forex market is that you have to buy when the market is going up and sell
when the market is going down.

51

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The word “forex” comes from Foreign Exchange, and forex is often ab breviated to FX.
Forex trading involves the buying and selling of currencies. In simpler
terms, it’s the exchange of one currency for another at an agreed upon
rate.
If you’ve ever traveled to another country, chances are you’ve traded
your currency against the local country’s currency. If you’ve done this,
you have a good idea of how forex trading works.
All the currency of the world is involved in the forex market. It may be
confusing to choose which one to trade, but all you really need to know
are the major currencies, which are the most frequently traded.
Here are the major currencies:

1.) U.S. Dollar (USD)
2.) Japanese Yen (JPY)
3.) British Pound (GBP)
4.) Swiss Franc (CHF)
5.) European Union Euro (EUR)
6.) Australian Dollar (AUD)
7.) New Zealand Dollar (NZD)
8.) Canadian Dollar (CAD)
The next thing you need to know is that forex is traded in currency pairs.
Trading currency pairs means you’re buying one currency while simulta neously selling another currency.

Examples:

The most heavily traded products in the forex market are typically:

EUR/USD
USD/JPY
GBP/USD

It’s very important for you to know that the forex markets are extremely
volatile. You can easily make (or lose) thousands of dollars in a single
day.
Many forex brokers offer "free quotes and charts" and "no commissions,"
but keep in mind that nothing is for free. You are paying a spread – i.e.
you CANNOT buy a currency and immediately sell it for the same
amount.
It's like at the exchange booths when you’re on vacation: you might ex change $100 into 80 Euro, but when you change the 80 Euro back into
dollars, you only receive $96. The same concept applies when trading
forex: you’re paying at least 2 "pips." This amounts to approximately
$20, depending on the currency pair you're trading.

53

The forex markets can be tricky – they shouldn’t be taken lightly.
Another disadvantage of forex trading is that you’re NOT trading at an
exchange: there is no "Foreign Exchange."
You’re trading against your broker: if you’re selling, then your broker is
buying from you, and vice versa. And that's why your broker is giving
you the quotes for free: he can basically give you *any* quote he
chooses, since there are no regulations.
Example:
Take a look at these forex quotes. All three of the following screenshots
were taken on Tuesday, January 1 st, 2007, at 3:00pm U.S. Easter Time.
Note: The time in the first two charts is displayed at GMT (+6 hours)
I used three different websites to obtain these quotes:

The first data source reports it at 1.4611.
The second data source shows 1.4748.
The third data source reports a high of 1.4640.

That's a difference of 137 ticks, which equals $1,370! Do you see the
problem? Forex prices are completely subjective.
Mini-Forex Trading
Although the capital requirements for trading the forex markets are al ready low, "Mini-Forex Trading" has become very popular recently.
Mini-forex trading is good for people who have just started in the forex
market and who don’t have enough funds to open a regular account. It
requires a smaller amount of capital compared to regular forex accounts
– a minimum of $250.
On this account, you can trade up to 5 mini lots. A mini lot is only 1/10 th
the size of a standard forex account.
Example:
On a regular account, a 25-pip stop loss is equal to a loss of $250. Since
a mini-forex account is just 1/10th of the standard forex account, this
stop loss amounts to only $25. Instead of trading in 100,000 units, you
are trading in 10,000 units.
What are the perks of mini-forex trading?
Even with just a small stake involved, you still get to enjoy benefits such
as a free trading platform – just like regular forex traders. A few other
benefits include state-of-the art trading software, charts, and resources.
In this way, you can build up your confidence in your trading skills while
slowly increasing your profits and trading position in the market. You get
to manage your money on a small scale before going for the higher
stakes in regular forex trading.
56

Step 1: Selecting a Market
You can also develop a sound trading strategy without getting too emo tionally involved in possible profits or losses. For practice, newbies can
start with paper trading; in the real market, they can start small with
mini-forex trading.
Conclusion:
Mini-forex trading requires a smaller amount of capital and less emo tional investment, and it provides the perfect opportunity for you to
slowly build up your skills and confidence as a trader. In a way, it pre pares you for the higher stakes of the more advanced world of foreign
exchange trading.
Let’s check forex trading against our criteria:
1.) Capital Requirements
Many forex brokers let you start with as little as $1,000 in
your trading account.
2.) Leverage
The typical leverage in the forex market is 1:100 – i.e. for
every $1,000 in your trading account, you can trade
$100,000. Recently, forex brokers started offering leverage
of 1:200, allowing you to trade $100,000 for every $500 in
your trading account.
3.) Liquidity
This is certainly not a problem in the forex market. Unfortu nately, since the forex market is decentralized, and there’s no
official exchange, you can’t get real-time volume data.
But, according to the Triennial Central Bank Survey of 2007,
the average turnover in the traditional foreign exchange mar ket is around $3.21 trillion daily, and it’s still growing.

57

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Here are the daily averages of turnover on the forex market
over the last 15 years:
$880 billion (April of 1992)
$1.15 trillion (April of 1995)
$1.65 trillion (April of 1998)
$1.42 trillion (April of 2001)
$1.97 trillion (April of 2004)
$3.21 trillion (April of 2007)
Source: Triennial Central Bank Survey – December 2007, www.bis.org

4.) Volatility
You will find decent volatility in the forex market. It’s not as
great as in the stock market, but because of the extremely
high leverage, even small movements can yield substantial
profits. Here are the average daily movements for three dif ferent currency pairs:
EUR/USD - between 0.5% and 1% per day
USD/JPY - between 0.5% and 1.5% per day
GBP/USD - between 0.5% and 1.5% per day
Keep in mind that these moves represent approximately
$750 - $1,500 per day for each $100,000 traded.
Conclusion:
Forex markets are extremely liquid and the capital requirements are as
low as $1,000. The leverage is at least 100:1 and there’s decent volatility.
Overall, forex seems to be a good market to trade, but keep in mind that
there are some disadvantages, too, as mentioned earlier in this section.

58

Step 1: Selecting a Market
Trading Futures
Futures trading continues to grow in popularity, and many traders are
jumping into this type of investing.
Futures trading offers many advantages, especially if you’re new to
trading. Yet many traders shy away from futures trading because they’re
not familiar it.
There’s a lot of misunderstanding when it comes to futures. People often
think that futures are extremely risky and difficult to trade. To some ex tent, that’s true. Thanks to high leverage, futures trading IS more risky
than stock trading.
However, futures trading – BECAUSE of the high leverage – also pro vides an excellent opportunity for the private trader.
So what are futures? Futures contracts, simply called futures, are ex change-traded derivatives. They are standardized contracts among buyers
and sellers of commodities that specify the amount of a commodity, the
grade/quality, and the delivery location. These futures contracts are typi cally traded at futures exchanges, like the Chicago Board of Trade
(CBOT), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the New York Mer cantile Exchange (NYMEX), and others.
Below is a list of different types of futures contracts:

1.) Currencies – The currency market is probably the best-known
commodity available, dealing in the British Pound, the American
Dollar, the European Euro, etc.

2.) Interest Rates – Interest rates are traded in two ways on this
market: long-term interest rates are represented by T-Bonds,
while T-Bills are used for short-term interest rates.

3.) Energies – A variety of fuel commodities are traded on this mar ket, including natural gas, heating oil, and crude oil futures.

59

The Complete Guide to Day Trading

4.) Food Sector – Sugar, coffee, and orange juice are just a few of
the regular goods traded in this sector.

5.) Metals – Commodities in this market are fairly well-known,
such as copper, gold, and silver.

6.) Agricultural – Futures in this market include wheat, corn, cof fee, and soybeans.
Futures are not borrowed like stock, and therefore initiating a short posi tion is just as common and easy as buying the futures.
A Little Bit of History
Trading on commodities began in early 18 th century Japan, with the
trading of rice and silk, and similarly in Holland, with tulip bulbs. Trad ing in the U.S. began in the mid-19 th century, when central grain markets
were established, and a marketplace was created for farmers to bring
their commodities and sell them either for immediate delivery (called the
spot or cash market), or for forward delivery. All contract trading began
with traditional commodities such as grains, meat, and livestock.
Exchange trading these days has expanded to include metals, energy,
currencies, currency indices, equities, equity indices, government interest
rates, and also private interest rates. Contracts on the financial instru ments were introduced in the 1970s by the Chicago Mercantile Ex change. These instruments became hugely successful and quickly over took commodities futures in terms of trading volume and global accessi bility in the markets.
All futures transactions in the United States are regulated by the Com modities Future Trading Commissions (CFTC), an independent agency
of the United States government. Each futures contract is characterized
by a number of factors, including the nature of the underlying asset,
when it must be delivered, the currency of the transaction, and at what
date the contract stops trading, as well as the tick size, or minimum legal
change in price.
60

Step 1: Selecting a Market
Here’s a list of the five most popular futures contracts:
1.) S&P 500 E-mini – This contract has all of the advantages of
the S&P 500, but the cost of investment is much lower. It can
be traded electronically five days a week, almost 24 hours a
day. It’s become exceptionally popular in the futures
markets.
2.) E-mini NASDAQ 100 – As with the S&P 500, this contract
is electronically traded; it tracks the movement of the
NASDAQ 100. The margin amount required to trade is sig nificantly smaller than a standard contract, and since not all
traders have the funds to trade on the regular NASDAQ 100,
this E-mini is the perfect solution.
3.) Light Sweet Crude Oil – Oil futures are one of the most
well-known commodities out there. Every time you hear
about “the price of oil” in the paper or on the news, this is
the contract they’re talking about.
4.) Gold – The gold futures contract is also popular. In the
1970s, the United States adopted the Gold Standard, creating
an important place in the U.S. economy for gold. Since that
time, the gold price has gone through regular, dramatic
changes, and those changes are usually in the opposite di rection of the U.S. dollar. The gold futures contract follows
the changes in price per ounce of gold, and gold investments
are frequently used in hedge funds.
5.) E-mini Euro FX – The E-mini Euro FX contract moves
with the exchange rate between the European Euro and the
U.S. dollar. As with the rest of the E-mini contracts, the
margin amounts required to trade the Euro FX are much
lower than the regular contract amounts, which means that
this contract presents a fantastic opportunity for traders who
don’t have accounts large enough to trade the regular con tracts.
The growing popularity of futures trading stems from the fact that only a
relatively small amount of money, known as initial margin, is required to
61

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
buy or sell a futures contract. By definition, these futures margins are a
good faith deposit to ensure that the market participants are legitimate.
Whenever you open a position by buying or selling futures, you will pay
a small initial margin. The advantage is that the initial margin on a stock
future is much less than the cost of buying the actual stock outright.
Example:
The following graphic shows an actual stock index, the S&P 500.

This index could rise from 1560 to 1570. As of October 12 th, 2007, it is
trading at around 1561.80. Some people think it’s less risky to trade the
whole market index rather than an individual stock. Therefore, the stock
exchanges have introduced an artificial stock named the SPY (also called
the SPYDER contract).

62

Step 1: Selecting a Market
The SPY stock actually mirrors the S&P 500 Index, because tradition ally,
you cannot trade the whole index. If you wanted to trade the whole S&P
500 index, you would literally have to buy all 500 stocks in the in dex.
Obviously, you can’t do this. In order to make it affordable for pri vate
traders, the SPY is divided by ten.

So, we’re tracking the index, and the artificial stock is reduced by a fac tor of 10 – it’s trading at 156. If the SPX (the index) moves from 1560 to
1570, then the SPY will move from 156 to 157.
If you’re trading one share of SPY, you will make or lose one dollar. And
how much capital is needed in order to trade one share? 156 dollars.

63

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
So, for 156 dollars, you will be rewarded with a one dollar profit if the
whole index moves by 10 points.
And, if you were trading 500 shares of the SPY, then you would make
500 dollars on a move of 10 points. Obviously, the capital needed for 500
shares is much higher than for one share. The capital needed is actu ally
156 dollars per share times the 500 shares that you would want to trade.
The total amount of capital needed to trade 500 shares would be 78,000
dollars.

78,000 dollars is quite a lot. The thing to look at here is your return on
investment, which is what most traders use to measure their success.
If you make five hundred dollars after investing 78,000 dollars, the re turn on that investment would be 0.6%. That’s a very small amount for a
10-point move in the underlying index.

64

Step 1: Selecting a Market
This is exactly why we have the futures markets . There’s enormous
leverage in the futures markets because you only have to deposit a rela tively small amount of money (initial margin).
Now, the following chart shows the futures contracts, the so-called Emini S&P:

You’ll see that the E-mini is tracking the index much closer – here we’re
looking at a current value of 1574.50. The important thing to know is
that if the E-mini S&P – which is also abbreviated as ES – moves from
1560 to 1570, you would actually make 500 dollars per contract.

65

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
And how much of an investment is required to make 500 dollars off one
contract in this move?
About 4,000 dollars.
The margin requirement for the E-mini S&P is approximately 4,000
dollars. And if you’re day trading it, you even get a discount, which
means you’ll only have to pay 2,000 dollars. Sometimes, it’s even as lit tle as $1,000.
So, you can deposit 4,000 dollars and participate in a 10-point move for a
profit of 500 dollars. Let’s calculate our return on that initial investment.
Instead of 0.6%, we are looking at 12.5%. That’s more than twenty times
the return you would have gotten using the SPY contract.

Of course, this can be a double-sided sword. You can easily make 500
dollars, but if the trade goes against you, you would lose 500 dollars. So
basically, trading one contract of the E-mini S&P is no different than
actually trading 500 shares of the SPY.
66

Step 1: Selecting a Market
The Futures Trading Myth
As you can see at the bottom of the previous chart, there are small Rs.
These Rs indicate expiration dates. A futures contract is only valid for a
certain period of time. In the case of the E-mini S&P, a futures contract is
valid for 3 months. You might know this concept from options. Op tions
also have an expiration date.
After the expiration date, a new futures contract starts trading and the old
contract expires. You might have heard horror stories that if you are
holding a position and the futures contract expires, then you will have to
take delivery. So, according to these tales, if you are trading the grains –
corn, for example – and the contract expires, you will get the corn deliv ered to your doorstep.
No! That will not happen!
Basically, what will happen is this: before the futures contract expires,
your broker will get in contact with you and send you some information.
It will probably be something to the effect of, “Alright, in a couple of
days, this futures contract will expire. We should get rid of this position
or roll it over.” Rollovers are when one contract expires, and the other
contract actually starts trading. This is something your broker will take
care of, so you don’t have to do anything on your end.
Believe me, your broker doesn’t have any interest in you getting a physi cal delivery of corn, you don’t have any interest in getting a physical de livery of corn, and it’s unlikely that anyone else has any interest in you
getting a physical delivery of corn either. So, don’t believe these horror
stories.
Just be accessible to your broker, and you shouldn’t have any problems.
Make sure that he has a number where you can be reached so that he can
inform you of what’s going on.

67

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
A Little More On Futures
Let’s go back to the S&P 500 Index. As you can see by the decimals in
the following graph, it’s trading at one-cent increments.

In order to make futures trading a little easier, it’s been simplified even
further. If you look at the following example, on the very right side, it’s
trading in quarter increments. If the E-mini S&P futures contract moves
from 1560 to 1570, you’ll make or lose 500 dollars, depending on what
kind of position you took. And if a 10 point move translates into a $500
gain or loss, then a 1 point move is worth $50.

68

Step 1: Selecting a Market
When trading the e-mini S&P, the minimum tick movement (or mini mum movement) is a quarter. So, you can see that it goes from 1550 to
1550 and a quarter, 1550 and a half, 1550 and three quarters, and then up
to 1551. If the minimum movement is a quarter, then every tick move
totals $12.50 (one quarter of $50). Very easy. There are four quarters in
one point, so you just have to divide the 50 dollars by four.

So, why is that important? Well, it’s not really – all you need to know is
that when trading one futures contract with anywhere between 2,000 to
4,000 dollars, you can make a return of 50 dollars per point. Keep in
mind that you can also LOSE 50 dollars per point.

69

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Remember, the 2,000 to 4,000 dollars we’re talking about is the initial
margin, which is the sum of money that a customer like you must deposit
with the brokerage firm for each futures contract that you buy or sell.
Now, just think about this for a minute: let’s assume that you have an
80,000 dollar account – what can you do with it? Well, you could buy
500 shares of the SPY stock. Or you could trade 20 futures contracts in
the ES. If you choose to trade the 20 futures contracts instead of the 500
SPY stock shares, you’ll make 10,000 dollars! If you stick with the SPY
shares, you’ll only make 500 dollars per 10-point move.
You can see the difference. You get a much bigger leverage on your ac count with futures trading, and a higher leverage is exactly what will
help you grow your account (as long as you know what you’re doing).

Margins and Accounts
There are two types of margins. The initial margin (sometimes called
the original margin) is the sum of money that the customer must deposit

70

Step 1: Selecting a Market
with the brokerage firm for each futures contract to be bought or sold.
Initial margin is paid by both buyer and seller.
Additionally, the maintenance margin is the minimum amount which an
investor must keep on deposit in a margin account at all times for each
open contract. Typically, the maintenance margin is smaller than the ini tial margin. Assume, for example, that the initial margin needed to buy or
sell a particular futures contract is $2,000. A likely maintenance mar gin
requirement might be $1,500.
Another important thing to be aware of when dealing with margins is
something called a margin call. If the margin drops below the margin
maintenance requirement established by the exchange listing the futures,
a margin call will be issued to bring the account back up to the required
level. Basically, if you need to have $1,500 in your account for your open
contracts, and you don’t, then you can expect a margin call.
Another difference in trading futures vs. stocks is that your account is
settled daily. Any day that profits accrue on your open positions, the
profits will be added to the balance in your margin account automati cally, not just when you close the position. When you are buying stocks,
all the money that you make or lose will be either added or subtracted to
your account only when you close the position.
So, when profits occur on your futures contracts, they will be added to
the balance of your margin account, and on any day losses accrue, the
losses will be deducted from the balance of your margin account.
Keep in mind, if the funds remaining in your margin account dip below
the maintenance margin requirement, your broker will require that you
deposit additional funds to bring the account back to the level of the re quired margin. Again, this is called a margin call.
Due to the low margin requirement, futures trading offers everyone an
equal opportunity to make a fortune even with a small bank account.
Pros and Cons of Futures Trading
Futures trading is amongst today’s most highly leveraged, potentially
profitable financial pursuits. It allows traders to build up their accounts
71

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
fast. But, as stated before, if you take futures trading lightly, you could
also wipe out your trading account in a matter of days. Therefore, it’s
crucial to your trading success that you diligently educate yourself in
futures trading, and trade only with a proven and solid trading strategy.
If you’re new to futures trading, it can be especially difficult to decide
WHICH contracts to actually trade. There are a lot of options! The best
approach would probably be to start with the more popular commodities,
until you have a better idea of which contracts most fit you and your
trading.
The more you know about the basics of futures contracts and commodi ties like this, the better your chances of trading success.
Let’s check futures trading against our criteria:
1.) Capital Requirements
In order to trade a futures contract, you need to deposit an
initial investment into your futures trading account. As of the
writing of this book, most futures brokers require a mini mum of $5,000, though I have seen some brokers who are
willing to open an account with as little as $2,000.
2.) Leverage
The leverage depends on the futures contract you’re trading
and the contract value. Each contract requires an initial mar gin. Here are some examples for the most popular contracts
(as of January 2008):
E-mini S&P – as low as $500 to trade a $75,000 contract
(Leverage 1:150)
E-mini NQ – as low as $500 to trade a $45,000 contract
(Leverage 1:90)
E-mini Gold – as low as $400 to trade a $27,000 contract
(Leverage 1:67.5)
72

Step 1: Selecting a Market
3.) Liquidity
Again, the liquidity depends on the futures contract you are
trading. Here are some numbers:
E-mini S&P:
E-mini NQ:
Euro Currency:

around 2,500,000 contracts/day
around 500,000 contracts/day
around 200,000 contract/day

As you can see, the liquidity varies, and therefore you
MUST check the volume of the futures market you are plan ning to trade.
4.) Volatility
You will find decent volatility in the futures markets. Like in
the forex markets, the high leverage will allow you to make
decent profits, even if the markets move just a few points.
Here are some average daily moves:
E-mini S&P:
E-mini NQ:
E-mini Gold:
Euro Currency:

between 1% and 3% per day
between 1% and 2.5% per day
between 1% and 2.5% per day
between 0.5% and 1.5% per day

Keep in mind that these moves represent approximately
$500-$1,500 per day for each contract traded.
Conclusion:
Futures markets can be very liquid, and the capital requirements are as
low as $2,000. The leverage is at least 1:50, and there’s decent volatility.
Futures markets are regulated and the spread is typically 1 tick (mini mum movement of the contract). Commissions are usually below $5 per
transaction. It’s no surprise that many day traders choose the futures
market for their trading endeavors.
Make sure to check the volume and liquidity of the market you want to
trade, since there are huge differences between the markets.
73

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Trading Stock Options
Stock options trading is quite similar to futures trading – they both in volve the process of buying stocks at a pre-determined price and then
selling them when the price rises above its original amount.
When you buy an option you have the right – but not the obligation – to
buy (call) or sell (put) a specific underlying asset at a prearranged price
on or before a given date.
Example:
Let’s assume that you buy a call – a right to buy – 100 shares of ACME
Holding Inc. at an agreed price of $40 per share (strike price), on an
agreed date in March of 2008 (expiration date), and you pay $5 for the
option.
If on – or before – the expiration date, ACME Holding Inc. is trading at
less than $40 per share, then you would not exercise your option and you
would have lost the price you paid on that option – $5.
But, if ACME Holding, Inc. is trading at $50 per share on or before the
expiration date, your option is, in effect, worth $10. This is the difference
between the price your option to buy ACME Holding, Inc. is set at – in
this case, $40 – and the price at which it is actually trading – $50.
The reverse of this is a put (right to sell) option on an underlying asset.
You might feel that the market is overheated at the present time, and you
want to buy a put (right to sell) option.
This will give the individual who bought the put option the right to sell
that option at an agreed upon price (strike price) on or before a specific
date (expiration date).

74

Step 1: Selecting a Market
A Little Bit of History
Options are one of the oldest trading vehicles which man has ever used.
Around 600 B.C., Thales used the stars to predict that there would be a
bumper olive harvest, and he bought options on the use of olive presses.
When the harvest did in fact prove to be a great one, Thales was able to
rent the presses out at a significant profit.
Let’s check stock options trading against our criteria:
1.) Capital Requirements
Like stock trading, day trading stock options is subject to the
Pattern Day Trading Rule introduced by the NYSE and NASD in
August and September of 2001. This rule dictates that “if a trader
executes four or more day trades within a five-business-day pe riod, then he must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in his
margin account at all times.” This means that you need at least
$28,000-$30,000 if you want to day trade stock options, since
you need some money to buy options.
2.) Leverage
The leverage depends on the option you choose. Without going
into too much detail, the price for the option depends on the time
until expiration, the volatility of the underlying stock, and the
“inner value” – i.e. if the option is already “in the money.”
Nevertheless, you will notice that options offer high leverage.
Example: On December 27, 2007, IBM was trading at $110.16
per share. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of IBM, then you
would have had to invest $11,016. The January Call, at a strike
price of $110, with 23 days left to expiration, only cost $3.30,
and you could buy the right to purchase 100 IBM shares within
the next 23 days for only $330.
In this example the leverage is approximately 1:30.
75

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
3.) Liquidity
Options are typically not very liquid. Even if you trade options
on the Dow 30 stocks, you will notice that only a few thousand
options are traded per day. The reason for the low volume is the
broad choice of options: at any given time you have several
strike prices and multiple expiration dates available.
Fortunately, option prices are NOT subject to market manipula tion since the value of an option is not determined by supply and
demand, but by a mathematical formula created by Black and
Scholes. But you do have a significant spread between the bid
and the ask; in our IBM example, $0.10 or 3% of the option
price.
4.) Volatility
Options that are traded “at the money” or “in the money” typi cally have a very high volatility. In our example, we chose an
IBM “at the money” option with 23 days to expiration. The cur rent price was $3.30, and throughout the day, it was trading as
high as $3.95. The previous day’s close was $4.30. Therefore,
the intraday volatility for this option was almost 20%. Consid ering the previous day’s close, the overall volatility was close to
30%.
Conclusion
Stock option trading offers similar advantages and disadvantages to stock
trading – you need a minimum of $25,000 in your trading account if you
want to day trade stock options. The leverage is higher than when you’re
trading stocks, but much lower than trading futures or forex. The liquid ity is very low compared to the other markets, and the volatility is scary.
Stock options are a fantastic instrument to trade when traded on daily or
weekly charts. Day trading stock options is extremely risky and difficult,
and not for the novice trader.

76

Step 1: Selecting a Market
Action Items:
 Decide which market you want to trade. Spend four more hours
learning about the market you choose. Surf the Internet and read
articles. Try to find out as much as you can about your preferred
market without being overloaded with information.
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 and fill in the market
you selected under “Selecting a Market.”

Step 2: Selecting a
Timeframe

W

hen day trading, you’ll obviously select a timeframe that is less
than one day.

Popular intraday timeframes are 60-minute, 30-minute, 15-minute, 10minute, 5-minute, 3-minute, and 1-minute.
When you select a smaller timeframe (less than 60 minutes), usually your
average profit per trade is relatively low. On the other hand, you get more
trading opportunities. When trading on a larger timeframe, your average
profit per trade will be bigger, but you’ll have fewer trading op portunities.
Smaller timeframes mean smaller profits, but usually smaller risk, too.
When you’re starting with a small trading account, you might want to
select a small timeframe to make sure that you’re not over-leveraging
your account.
However, when selecting a very small timeframe like 1-minute, 3minute, or 5-minute, you might experience a lot of “noise” that is cause
by hedge funds, by scalpers, and by automated trading.
You might think that you see an emerging trend just to realize that it was
only a short manipulated move and that the trend is over as soon as you
enter the market.

78

Therefore I recommend using 15-minute charts. This timeframe is
small enough for you to capture the nice intraday moves, but it’s big
enough to eliminate the noise in the market and correctly displays the
“true trends.”
When developing a trading strategy, you should always experiment with
different timeframes. A trading strategy that doesn’t work on a small
timeframe might work on a larger timeframe and vice versa.
Start developing your trading strategy using 15-minute charts, and if
you’re unhappy with the results, change the timeframe first before
changing the entry or exit rules.
Action Items:
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 and select an initial
timeframe for yourself under “Selecting a Timeframe.”

79

Step 3: Selecting a
Trading Approach

A

fter selecting a market, you need to decide which trading ap proach
you would like to use.

The main question is whether you’ll use fundamental or technical analy sis to decide which instrument to trade and when to enter and exit.
Fundamental Analysis
Let’s take a look at the definition of fundamental analysis :
"Fundamental stock analysis requires, among other things, a
close examination of the financial statements for the company to
determine its current financial strength, future growth and prof itability prospects, and current management skills, in order to
estimate whether the stock's price is undervalued or overvalued.
A good deal of reliance is placed on annual and quarterly earn ings reports, the economic, political and competitive environ ment facing the company, as well as any current news items or
rumors relating to the company's operations."
Source: www.daytrading.about.com

In other words, fundamental analysis is the study of basic, underlying
factors that affect the supply and demand of the contracts which are be -

80

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
ing traded. Fundamental analysis looks at the CAUSE of market move ment.
In the following graph, you’ll find a snapshot of some “key statistics” for
IBM. In addition to this company-specific data, you need to take the
overall economic environment into consideration and start looking at
various macroeconomic indicators, such as economic growth rates, inter est rates, inflation rates, and unemployment rates.
As an example, interest rate hikes are seldom good news for stock mar kets. This is due to the fact that many investors will withdraw money
from a country's stock market when there is a hike of interest rates,
causing the country's currency to weaken.
Knowing which effect prevails can be tricky. When the Fed announced
an interest rate cut in December of 2007, the Dow Jones Index dropped
300 points. When the Fed cut interest rates in January of 2008, the Dow
Jones Index jumped 200 points up.
In addition, economic reports with key data like the PPI, CPI, PMI, GDP,
and, recently, even housing statistics, have proven to have a significant
impact on the stock market.
Confused?
If the abbreviations and the “key statistics” on the following graph don’t
make sense to you, or if they confuse you, then you are not alone.
Fundamental analysis is not easy. That’s why most market analysts have
some background in economics, both macro- and microeconomics. Big
trading companies like Goldman Sachs are employing analysts with
Ph.D.s in economics, and you shouldn’t try to compete with them.
Even if you decide NOT to trade stocks and want to focus on futures or
the forex market, then you still need to take a look at crop and weather
reports (if you are trading grain futures), interest rates and the country’s
economic data (if you are trading forex), or follow developments in the
Middle East and the status of the pipelines and refineries all over the
world (if you are trading energy futures).

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Technical Analysis
Here is how technical analysis is defined:
“The basic foundations or premises of technical analysis are
that a stock's current price discounts all information available in
the market, that price movements are not random, and that pat terns in price movements, in very many cases, tend to repeat
themselves or trend in some direction.
Therefore technical analysis involves the study of a stock's trad ing patterns through the use of charts, trendlines, support and
resistance levels, and many other mathematical analysis tools, in
order to predict future movements in a stock's price, and to help
identify trading opportunities.”
Source: www.daytrading.about.com

In summary, there are three main points that a technical analyst applies:



Market action discounts everything. Regardless of what the
fundamentals are saying, the price you see is the price you get.



The price of a given security moves in trends.



The historical trading patterns of a security will tend to repeat.

All three of the points above are important, but the first is the most criti cal. It’s vital that you understand this point, because it’s the basis of our
approach to trading.
When you look at the price of any financial instrument as a technical
analyst, you believe that it’s the true value of the instrument as the mar ket sees it.
I believe in technical analysis for a couple of reasons.

83

The Complete Guide to Day Trading



The markets are driven by greed and fear, and not by supply and
demand. An economic report itself is meaningless: it is traders’
reactions to the report that moves the market.
Price data is more “objective.” You can interpret financial data
and economic reports any way you want, but support levels are
support levels, and a weekly high is a weekly high. It’s easier to
interpret hard facts more than financial statements, because
many times these statements might be misleading.
Example: IBM announces that it will meet the projected sales
targets, and the shares drop like a rock, because traders hoped
that IBM would exceed its goals. Another day, DELL announces
that they will meet their targets, and the shares jump up, because
traders didn’t believe that DELL would make it due to the “diffi cult economic environment.”



It’s easier (and therefore faster) to learn technical analysis. You
can learn the basics by reading a couple of books, whereas you
need to study micro- and macro-economics to master funda mental analysis. And even then, you might be fooled by the mar ket.
An Example Of How Fundamental Analysis Can Fool You

On Friday, April 7 th, 2006, the unemployment rate for March was pub lished. The market expected an unemployment rate of 4.8%, and the
numbers came in better than expected.
Only 4.7%. That's good news, isn't it? The market should move up,
right?
WRONG! On that day the E-mini S&P dropped 20 points. Why?
Well, here are some comments from a news service:
"Not surprisingly, Friday’s equity trade was dictated by the March em ployment report. More specifically, it was the Treasury market’s reaction
to it that set the stage for stocks."
84

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
"A lack of negative surprise caused the stock market to
breathe a sigh of relief.”
"The Treasury market had a very divergent reaction to the data, and it
took the stock market down with it. For Treasury traders, the in-line data
essentially provided no evidence that the Fed will be inclined to soon end
its monetary tightening cycle."
Oops. So the stock traders thought there was good news and the market
was moving up, but the treasury trader in the other room thought the un employment data was bad news. So treasury instruments were rallying,
causing the stock market to drop like a rock. But don't stocks lead the
treasuries? Or do treasuries lead stocks?
The next day, another news item hit the ticker:
“Oil Prices Trading Above $69 per Barrel!”
But what does it mean? Should the stock market move up or down?
Here's a discussion I heard the next morning:
"As crude oil prices continue to plug higher, the debate over what it all
really means will begin again. The question that will be batted back &
forth: "Are sky-high oil prices indicative of a coming economic slow down or looming inflation?"
And more important: how will the Fed react? Will they cease increasing
interest rates or even lower the rates again? This would provide a boost
for the stock market.
Or will traders fear that there's an economic slowdown which might re sult in lower company earnings? This would move the market down.
As you can see, it's not the news that moves the market – it's the reaction
of the traders to the news that makes the prices jump up and down.

85

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Using a technical approach, you don’t have to twist your mind to come
up with an explanation for why the market behaves as it does. You sim ply believe that the factors which affect price – including fundamental,
political, and psychological factors – have all been built into the price
you see.
This means that anything which can affect the price of a financial in strument has already been factored into the current price by the market
participants. Technical analysts look at charts the same way a doctor
would look at x-rays: they examine the charts for information on the fu ture direction of the markets.
Day Trading Charts
If you’re new to the trading game, and you’re not a Ph.D. in Economics,
then charts are the way to go. The most basic charts are bar and line
charts. In fact, even if you’re an experienced trader, bar and line charts
probably still have a special place in your daily trading life. These charts
are simply indispensable.
“A picture speaks a thousand words.” This proverb holds just as true for
charts. Charting is the graphical expression of a financial market’s be havior over a period in time.
Any market has four different trading points throughout one day. They
are: opening price (O), closing price (C), absolute high price of the day
(H), and the absolute low price of the day (L). All of these points appear
on the charts.
The opening price (O) is the first trade of the day. Individual traders tend
to place orders when the market opens, in reaction to the previous day’s
close. This price will normally be based on emotional decisions and
could well indicate how the first half – or the whole day’s trading – is
going to pan out.
The closing price (C) is the last trade of the day. It is generally institu tional investors that place orders towards the day’s close. Unlike the
opening price, the closing price will normally be representative of deci sions made by reason and research – not gut feel.
86

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
The day’s low (L) and the day’s high (H) are pretty self-explanatory. The
difference between the high and low on the charts is referred to as the
Range.
The fifth variable displayed on a chart is typically the volume (V), speci fying the number of shares, lots, or contracts traded during the time pe riod between the open of the market and the close.
Purely looking at these five points on the charts will not be enough to
plan future trades. You need to look at them over a series of time in order
to evaluate trends in the market.
Day traders use trading charts to watch the markets that they trade, and
decide when to make their trades. There are several different types of
trading charts, but they all show essentially the same trading information,
such as the past and current prices.
In the following section, we’ll discuss the three most popular types of
trading charts.
Bar Charts
A bar chart, also known as a bar graph, is a chart with rectangular bars
whose lengths are proportional to the value they represent. Bar charts are
used for comparing two or more values.
The bar chart is one of the most common charting methods. A bar chart
indicates a single bar that extends from the high to the low of the trading
period it is meant to depict. In addition, the opening and closing price
levels could be displayed as small branches coming away from the main
bar at the appropriate level. Closing prices are put on the right side of the
bar. Opening prices are put on the left side.

87

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
How to Read Bar Charts
Bar charts consist of an opening foot, a vertical line, and a closing foot.
Each bar includes the open, high, low, and close of the timeframe, and
also shows the direction (upward or downward), and the range of the
timeframe.

During live trading, you can read the bar chart like this:

1.) Open – The open is the first price traded during the bar, and is
indicated by the horizontal foot on the left side of the bar.

2.) High – The high is the highest price traded during the bar, and is
indicated by the top of the vertical bar.

3.) Low – The low is the lowest price traded during the bar, and is
indicated by the bottom of the vertical bar.

88

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach

4.) Close – The close is the last price traded during the bar, and is
indicated by the horizontal foot on the right side of the bar.

5.) Direction – The direction of the bar is indicated by the locations
of the opening and closing feet. If the closing foot is above the
opening foot, the bar is an upward bar, and if the closing foot is
below the opening foot, the bar is a downward bar. Sometimes a
charting software allows you to color these bars, in which case
the upward bars are typically colored green, and the downward
bars are colored red.

6.) Range – The range of the bar is indicated by the locations of the
top and bottom of the bar. The range is calculated by subtracting
the low from the high (range = high - low).

Candlestick Charts
Candlestick charts are not new – they’ve been used for hundreds of years
by Japanese traders to predict and act on market movements.
Candlestick charting gives greater insight into human psychology.
In the 1700s, Homma, a Japanese trader in rice, noticed how the price of
rice was influenced by human psychology as much as by the supply and
demand situation. Homma used candlestick charts to trade rice and
amassed a huge fortune in the markets. In fact, it was rumored that he
never had a single losing trade!
Human psychology has never changed; it has remained constant over
time – candlestick charting is just as useful today as it was hundreds of
years ago.
Even though they may look a little complicated, there are some great rea sons to use candlestick charts. Here are the main ones:



Complement Other Technical Tools
You can use candlestick charts as you would use the common bar
chart, and you can combine them with traditional market in dicators. Candlestick charts are a great way to spot opportunities,
filter, and time trades with other indicators.



Spotting Trend Changes
Because of the way candlestick charts are viewed, they can give
you visual warnings of market reversals much more clearly than
traditional bar charts. If you look at candlestick charting, the
human psychology of the move literally jumps out of the page at
you.



Straightforward to Use
Candlestick charts use the same open, high, low, and close data
90

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
that traditional bar charts use, and are easy to draw. The different
candle names are also easy to remember.



Define Market Momentums
The way the candlestick chart is drawn not only gives the direc tion of price, but also the momentum behind the move.

How to Read Candlestick Charts
Candlestick charts consist of a wide vertical line, and a narrow vertical
line. Each candlestick includes the open, high, low, and close of the time frame, the direction (upward or downward) of the timeframe, and the
range of the timeframe.
During live trading, you can read the candlestick chart like this:

1.) Open – The open is the first price traded during the candlestick,
and is indicated by either the top or bottom of the wide vertical
line (the bottom for an upward candlestick, and the top for a
downward candlestick).

2.) High – The high is the highest price traded during the candle stick, and is indicated by the top of the thin vertical bar (the wick
of the candlestick).

3.) Low – The low is the lowest price traded during the candlestick,
and is indicated by the bottom of the thin vertical bar (the upside
down wick of the candlestick).

4.) Close – The close is the last price traded during the candlestick,
and is indicated by either the top or bottom of the wide vertical
line (the top for an upward candlestick, and the bottom for a
downward candlestick).

5.) Direction – The direction of the candlestick is indicated by the
color of the candlestick (specifically the wide vertical line). Usu ally, if the candlestick is green, the candlestick is an upward
91

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
candlestick, and if the candlestick is red, the candlestick is a
downward candlestick, but these colors can be customized. In
the following chart, the upward candlesticks are colored white,
and the downward candlesticks are colored black.

6.) Range – The range of the candlestick is indicated by the loca tions of the top and bottom of the thin vertical lines (the wicks).
The range is calculated by subtracting the low from the high
(range = high - low).

The candlestick chart body graphically illustrates the relationship behind
the open, high, low, and close, and this adds an extra visual edge, due to
the way they’re drawn.
The candlestick has a wide part, called the "real body." This real body
represents the range between the open and close of that day's trading.
If the real body is filled with red, it means the close was lower than the
open. If the real body is green, it means the opposite – the close was
higher than the open.
92

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Above and below the real body we see the "shadows." We see these as
the wicks of the candle (which give them their name). The shadows actu ally show the high and the low of the day's trading.
If the upper shadow on the red filled-in body is short, it indicates that the
open that day was closer to the high of the day. On the other hand, a short
upper shadow on a green or unfilled body shows the close was near the
high.
Regardless, of whether you’re a day trader, a position trader, a system
trader, or a trader who likes to make your own trades, there’s really
nothing to dislike about candlestick charts.
They’re easy, and they’re fun to use. Plus, they provide greater insight
into market moves, along with the versatility to be used in any type of
trading. If you aren’t already using candlestick charting, then it’s time to
start.

93

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Line Charts
A simple line chart draws a line from one closing price to the next clos ing price. Line charts show the general price movement over a period of
time. Some investors and traders consider the closing level to be more
important than the open, high, or low. By paying attention to only the
close, intraday swings can be ignored.

Line charts are also used when open, high, and low data points are not
available. Sometimes only the closing data is available for certain indi ces, thinly traded stocks, and intraday prices.
How to Read Line Charts
Line charts consist of individual points that are connected with straight
lines. Usually, each point shows the close of the timeframe, but this can
be modified to show any info – open, high, or low. Line charts also show
the direction (upward or downward) of the timeframe.

94

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Using Charts In Your Trading
Most charting software supports bar, candlestick, and line charts. Nor mally, you can customize the display and colors according to your wish.
You can use any reliable online charting service you want. Just make
sure they provide the basic analytical tools (e.g. the capability to draw
trendlines, and the option to add moving averages). There are so many
charting services out there that it would be hard to mention any one in
particular.
Let’s just put it this way: charts are not the crystal ball of trading.
Charts do not foretell future market behaviors or predict market prices.
They offer you a concise and accurate history of the price movements of
a particular market. In that history lays a trend, and it is from this trend
that you can extrapolate data on which to base your future projections of
probable market behaviors and price changes. That’s the greatest value
that you’ll get when it comes to using charts.

95

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Technical Indicators
Let’s keep it simple: money is made if you buy when the market is going
up and sell when the market is going down. That’s why technical ana lysts hold to the motto "the trend is your friend.”
Finding the prevailing trend will help you become aware of the overall
market direction and offer you better visibility – especially when shortterm movements tend to clutter the picture.
Trends
The price chart of a security may appear like a random distribution, but
this is not so.
About 30% of the time, a security will be in a definite trend. The rest of
the time, prices will trade more or less in a sideways range. Our job is to
recognize trends early, as they emerge from non-trends, or as reversals of
prior trends.
Our goal is to buy or sell our security early in these new trends, exiting
the trade profitably when the trend ends. This identification of trend,
both its beginning and end, is the most important task we have as traders.
A simple definition of trend is basically the general direction of price
movements. An uptrend is present when prices make a series of higher
highs and higher lows. A downtrend is present when prices make a series
of lower highs and lower lows.
When prices move without such a discernible series, prices are said to be
trading sideways in a range, or trading trend-less. Once a trend is dis cernible, then trendlines can be drawn to define the lower limits of an
uptrend or the upper limits of a downtrend.
It is essential that trendlines be drawn correctly. It is the recognition of
the trendline and the violation of this trendline that is your key to suc cessful trading and fortune building.
96

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Does All of This Sound Too Simple?
I know that these simple definitions sound mundane, and that many trad ers would like to jump right into complicated indicators and complex
trading strategies.
Don’t make this mistake.
Trading can be simple: you buy when the market is going up and you sell
when the market is going down. That’s how money is made.
But if you don’t know HOW to recognize when the market is going up,
and when it’s going down, then you’ll lose money very quickly. So you
MUST find an easy way to identify the direction of the market.
The easiest way to do so is using trendlines.
Indicators are another way to determine the direction of the market, but if
you learn how to identify the trend using simple trendlines, then you’ll
never have to worry about indicators again.
The only two questions that remain are:
* When should I enter?
* When should I exit?
Just keep reading for the answers.

Uptrend
Let me show you exactly how to draw a trendline.
The following chart is a 5-minute bar chart of the E-mini S&P. The
trading day is December 20 th, 2007.

As you can see, prices have been moving down all morning, and then
they started moving sideways during the lunch break.
At 11:50pm (Central Standard Time) we see the low of the day.

98

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Prices have found resistance at 1462.50, and at 12:25pm, prices break
resistance on high volume. Obviously, prices are now in an uptrend, and
it’s time to draw our trendline.

In an uptrend, trendlines are drawn below the prices, while in a
downtrend, trendlines are drawn above the prices.

99

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
In order to draw a line, we need two points. The first point is the low of
the day and the second point is the first retracement, when prices are no
longer making higher lows.

The first time prices are not making a higher low occurs at the 12:15pm
bar, and we can draw our trendline. The dark part of the line is the
confirmed trend and the light part of the line is the projected trend.

100

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
At 12:35pm, we see a lower low in an upward trend for the second time,
but we do NOT adjust the trendline.
As a rule, trendlines can only become flatter, not steeper. Adjusting
the trendline to the second lower low would make a steeper trendline;
therefore, no change is made.

101

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
At 12:45pm and 12:50pm, a lower low is made again, and this time we
adjust the trendline. It’s only a slight adjustment and the trendline be comes a little bit flatter. All previous prices are above the trendline, so
the trend is still intact.

102

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
The next lower low occurs at 1:05pm, and we can extend our trendline.
It’s a simple extension: no adjustment is needed, and we see that the
uptrend has now been in place for 40 minutes, since the breakout through
the resistance level at 1462.50 at 12:25pm.

103

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Ten minutes later, we get the next lower low, and we adjust the trendline
accordingly. See how beautifully the previous lower lows are almost
touching the trendline? A perfect trend.

104

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Again we see a lower low, but we don’t adjust the trendline since it
would make the line steeper. Remember the rule: we can only flatten the
line, we can’t make it steeper.

105

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Another lower low occurs at 1:50pm, but we don’t adjust the trendline.

106

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
In this next chart, we see a series of lower lows, but only the lower low at
2:05pm allows us to adjust the trendline. The series of lower lows indi cates that the trend is coming to an end.

107

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Fifteen minutes later, we have another lower low, but at the same time,
we are experiencing a higher high after a series of lower highs. Lower
highs are indicating a possible downtrend, and when we see the first
higher high, it’s time to start drawing a downtrend line.

108

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
It seems that our uptrend has come to an end. The uptrend line is broken,
and we have another higher high that confirms our downtrend line.

109

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The uptrend was in place from 12:25pm until 2:25pm, for a full two
hours. During this time, prices moved from 1462.50 (a break through the
resistance level) to a high of 1472. The uptrend was broken at 1467.75.

110

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
There are two key things to remember about trendlines:



Never adjust a trendline so that it becomes steeper.
Don’t run a trendline through price bars. An uptrend line is always
below the price bars.

111

The Complete Guide to Day Trading



Keep a trendline close to the lower lows and don’t move it too far
away.
If there’s too much distance between your line and the lower
lows, you risk missing a change in the trend.

112

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Downtrend
A downtrend line is constructed in a similar way to that of the uptrend
line. The main difference is that you’re looking for a higher high, and
you draw the trendline ABOVE the price bars.
Here we have a 5-minute chart of the E-mini S&P on December 20 th,
2007. The opening price is also the highest price, and 15 minutes after
the opening, at 8:45am, we have the first higher high. So we can draw
our downtrend line.

113

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The market keeps falling, and at 9:10am, we see the next higher high.
However, we don’t adjust the trendline since it would mean making the
line steeper.

114

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
We see another higher high at 9:35am, but we still don’t adjust the
trendline. The 9:40am bar marks another higher high and confirms our
previous trendline.

115

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Ten minutes and two bars later, we have another higher high, and we can
adjust our line. Note that it’s still very close to the previous higher highs,
so the adjustment is valid.

116

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
The market makes another higher high, but we don’t adjust the trendline
since it would make the line steeper. See how beautifully our trendline
captures this downtrend?

117

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The trend continues, and at 11:15am, almost three hours after the open ing, we can adjust the trendline again. The trendline is still very close to
the previous higher highs.

118

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Fifteen minutes later, we get the next higher high, but if we adjust the
trendline, it will move it too far away from the previous higher highs; the
downtrend is broken.

119

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Adjusting the trendline would move it too far away from previous higher
highs, and we risk missing a change in the trend.

Trendline Validity
The validity of a trendline is dependent on its duration and the number of
times it’s been successfully tested.
The longer the trendline has been in effect and the more times it has been
successfully tested, the more important the trendline becomes. Conse quently, when a trendline of long duration – which has been successfully
tested many times – is violated, then an important reversal of trend is
likely to have occurred.

120

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Trading Range
This is a trading pattern that occurs in between an uptrend and a down trend. It points to equilibrium in supply and demand. Sideways trends
follow a horizontal direction, where the price stays relatively constant.
Trading patterns are also used in order to set support and resistance lev els, which are very useful for the technical analysis of charts.
Support & Resistance
Support and resistance levels are points where a chart experiences recur ring upward or downward pressure. A support level is usually the low
point in any chart pattern (hourly, weekly, or annually), whereas a resis tance level is the high or the peak point of the pattern.
These points are identified as support and resistance when they show a
tendency to reappear. It’s best to buy near support or sell near resistance
levels that are unlikely to be broken. Once these levels are broken, they
invariably reverse their roles. Previous support becomes resistance and
previous resistance becomes support.
Support and resistance levels are very important to your trading; it’s
critical that you understand them.
In uptrends, every time the price drops to the uptrend line and then re sumes its advance, the trendline has acted as support to the price uptrend.
Support can also be found at prices of previous support or resistance.
In downtrends, every time the price rises to the downtrend line and then
resumes its decline, the downtrend line has acted as resistance to the up ward move of market prices.
Consider the following: when price action drops to a certain level, the
bulls (the buyers) take control and prevent prices from falling lower.
Similar to support, a resistance level is the point at which bears (the sell ers) take control of prices and prevent them from rising higher.

121

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The price at which a trade takes place is the price at which a bull and
bear agree to do business. It represents the consensus of their expecta tions. The bulls think prices will move higher and the bears think prices
will move lower.
Support levels indicate the price at which a majority of investors believe
that prices will move higher, and resistance levels indicate the price at
which a majority of investors feel prices will move lower.
The development of support and resistance levels is probably the most
noticeable and reoccurring event on price charts.
Example:
As you can see from the following chart, prices have been in a down trend. On the same bar that broke the downtrend, prices went to the re sistance level at 1464.00 and retraced. 10 minutes later, they went 2 ticks
above the resistance level, but closed AT the resistance level.
For the next 2 hours and 30 minutes, prices never go above the resistance
level of 1464, but they repeatedly test this level, eventually breaking out.

122

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Whenever you can draw a resistance line, you can typically draw a corre sponding support line, as shown in the following chart.

As you can see, the support line holds very well, even though it’s broken
later. However, the break isn’t significant, since prices close above the
support line.

123

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
A Little More on Support and Resistance
Support is the price level at which demand is thought to be strong
enough to prevent the price from declining further.
The logic dictates that as the price declines towards support and gets
cheaper, buyers become more inclined to buy and sellers become less
inclined to sell. By the time the price reaches the support level, it’s be lieved that demand will overcome supply and prevent the price from fal ling below support.
Resistance is the price level at which selling is thought to be strong
enough to prevent the price from rising further.
The logic dictates that as the price advances towards resistance, sellers
become more inclined to sell and buyers become less inclined to buy. By
the time the price reaches the resistance level, it’s believed that supply
will overcome demand and prevent the price from rising above resis tance.

124

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Trendlines & Trend Channels
Trendlines are simple, yet helpful, tools in confirming the direction of
market trends. An upward straight line is drawn by connecting at least
two successive lows. Naturally, the second point must be higher than the
first.
The continuation of the line helps determine the path along which the
market will move. An upward trend is a concrete method to identify sup port lines/levels. Conversely, downward lines are charted by connecting
two points or more. The validity of a trading line is partly related to the
number of connection points. Yet it's worth mentioning that points must
not be too close together.

125

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
A channel is defined as the price path drawn by two parallel trendlines.
The lines serve as an upward, downward, or straight corridor for the
price.
Note that when drawing trend channels, you first draw the trendline and
then construct the “channel line” as a parallel line to the primary
trendline.
Trend channels are typically constructed to derive entry and exit points in
an uptrend or downtrend.

126

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
In a downtrend, you’d sell at the primary downtrend line and buy back at
the secondary channel line, as shown in the following example:

Popular Trading Approaches
By now, you know that any market is either trending or moving side ways. Therefore you’ll apply one of the following two trading strategies:

1.) Trend-following – when prices are moving up, you buy, and
when prices are going down, you sell.

2.) Trend-fading – when prices are trading at an extreme (e.g. up per
band of a channel), you sell, and then you try to catch the small
move while prices are shifting back into “normalcy.” The same
applies for buying.
Most indicators that you’ll find in your charting software belong to one
of these two categories: indicators for identifying trends (e.g. moving
averages), or indicators that define overbought or oversold situations,
which offer you a trade setup for a short-term swing trade.
Don’t become confused by all the possibilities of entering a trade. Just
make sure that you understand WHY you’re using a certain indicator and
WHAT that indicator is measuring.
Here are some examples of popular trading approaches:
Trend-following:






Moving Averages
Crossover of Moving Averages
Turtle Trading
Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD)

Trend-fading:





Williams %R
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Bollinger Bands and Channels

128

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Simple Moving Averages
If you believe in the "trend-is-your-friend" tenet of technical analysis,
moving averages (MA) are very helpful. Moving averages tell the aver age price in a given point of time over a defined period of time, typically
the closing price. They’re called ‘moving’ because they reflect the latest
average, while adhering to the same time measure.
A weakness of moving averages is that they lag the market, so they do
not necessarily signal a change in trends. To address this issue, use a
shorter period, such as a 5- or 10-day moving average, which will be
more reflective of the recent price action than the 40- or 200-day moving
averages. The concept is simple:


A buy signal is generated when the closing price moves
above the moving average.



A sell signal is generated when the closing price dips below
the moving average.

Here’s an example using the 10-minute chart of Amazon (AMZN):

129

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
You can see that this strategy works very well in trending markets (see
first buy signal), but in sideways moving markets, you’re getting whip sawed (see second buy signal).
The Right Concept for the Right Market
Every day, a great deal of traders attempt to use strategies based on
moving averages. And then they complain that these strategies don’t
work.
Keep in mind that this is a trend-following strategy – you should only
apply it in trending markets.
You might want to use trendlines or other indicators to ensure that the
market you’re watching is actually trending, and then use moving aver ages to get your specific entry signals.

130

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Crossover of Moving Averages
Another very popular approach is to use two moving averages: a “fast”
moving average (e.g. 14 bars) and a “slow” moving average (e.g. 20
bars). The amount of days used for the slow-moving average needs to be
larger than the amount of days used for the fast moving average.


A buy signal is generated when the fast-moving average crosses
the slow moving average from below.



A sell signal is generated when the fast moving average crosses
the slow moving average from above.

Here’s an example of this strategy:

The upper line is the slow-moving average (20 bars), and the lower line
is the fast moving average (14 bars).

131

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Turtle Trading
You’ll find plenty of articles on the Internet that will explain the turtle
trading rules in detail. Basically, the turtles look at the high and the low
through the past 20 days and generate the following signals:


A buy signal is generated when the current prices move higher
than the high of the previous 20 bars.



A sell signal is generated when the current prices move lower
than the low of the previous 20 bars.

Prices moved below the 20-bar low at 1.4372 and generated a short sig nal. Prices moved as low as 1.4324 (= 48 pips or $480) before retracing.
Please note that we just defined an entry signal. You still need to apply
profit targets and stop losses (see the next two chapters).

132

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
Another trend-following indicator is the Moving Average Conver gence/Divergence (MACD), developed by Gerald Apple. This indicator
shows the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The most
popular parameter for the MACD is the difference between a 26-bar ex ponential moving average (EMA) and the 12-bar. This difference is then
plotted on the chart and oscillates above and below zero.
A 9-bar EMA of the MACD, called the "signal line," is then plotted on
top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy and sell signals (dark
gray line).

133

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Traders utilize the MACD in different ways, but the most popular is to
use the signal line for entry signals:


A buy signal is generated when the signal line (dark grey
line) crosses the MACD (light grey line) from below.



A sell signal is generated when the signal line (dark grey
line) crosses the MACD (light grey line) from above.

134

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Williams %R
One of the most popular overbought/oversold indicators is Williams %R.
This indicator was developed in 1966 by Larry Williams to help traders
identify overbought and oversold positions in the market.
Williams %R, sometimes referred to as %R, compares a stock's close to
the high-low range over a certain period of time.
The formula is quite simple: it subtracts the current day's close from the
lowest intraday low of the last ‘X’ number of days, and then divides this
distance by the highest high minus the lowest low of the last ‘X’ number
of days. This computation tells us where, within the next day range, to day's close is located. If it’s high in the range it will be in the high per centiles, say over 80%. If we’re closing low in the range of the last ‘X’
number of days, it would be in the 20% or lower area.
The index has many uses, but the simplest one is just allowing it to iden tify or suggest an overbought, oversold zone.
The index can be used in all markets and in all timeframes. Most traders
use it successfully on intraday bar charts with a parameter of 14 bars.
As stated above, the indicator shows the relationship of the closing price
to a high-low range over a specific period of time, typically 14 bars.
The result is plotted on a chart and oscillates between 0 and 100. The
basic idea is that if prices are trading at the high of the high-low range
(indicator reading close to 100), then the market is overbought, and if the
current prices are trading close to the low of the specified range (indica tor reading close to 0), then the market is oversold.


A sell signal is generated when the indicator has a value
above 80.



A buy signal is generated when the indicator has a value
below 20.

135

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
In this example chart, the %R moves above 80, indicating that Google
(GOOG) is “oversold,” and a sell signal is generated.
Williams %R works best in sideways-moving markets.

136

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
Relative Strength Index (RSI)
Another popular overbought/oversold indicator is the Relative Strength
Index (RSI), developed by Welles Wilder. The RSI compares the mag nitude of a stock's recent gains to the magnitude of its recent losses and
turns that information into a number which ranges from 0 to 100. It takes
a single parameter – the number of time periods – to use in the calcula tion. In his book, Wilder recommends using 14 periods.


A sell signal is generated when the RSI crosses the 70-line (over bought-zone) from above.



A buy signal is generated when the RSI crosses the 30-line (over sold-zone) from below.

The RSI dips below 30 and a buy signal is generated, coincidentally at
the low of the day. By applying stop loss and profit exit strategies (see
next chapter), profits could be realized quite quickly.
As with the %R, the RSI indicator works best in sideways-moving mar kets.
137

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Bollinger Bands and Channels
Many traders are familiar with the concept of “Bollinger Bands.”
Bollinger Bands consist of a moving average and two standard devia tions, one above the moving average and one below. The important thing
to know about Bollinger Bands is that they contain up to 95% of the
closing prices, depending on the settings.
The most popular setting is a 21-bar moving average (solid dark grey
line) and 2 standard deviations for the upper and lower band (dotted grey
line).


A buy signal is generated when prices move below the lower
Bollinger Band.



A sell signal is generated when prices move above the upper
Bollinger Band.

138

Step 3: Selecting a Trading Approach
This is a 10-minute chart of the E-mini S&P. After lackluster trading in
the morning, prices move above the upper Bollinger Band and generate a
sell signal.

Two hours later, prices move below the lower Bollinger Band and create
a buy signal.
This indicator works best in sideways-moving markets.

139

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Trading Approaches
Before deciding on a trading approach, you need to identify whether the
market is trending or moving sideways.
Don’t fall prey to the common mistakes. Many traders simply decide on
one trading approach and trade it all the time, whether the market is
trending or not. That’s a sure way to failure.
Successful traders use multiple trading approaches: they have at least one
approach for a trending market and another approach for a sidewaysmoving market. Using the basic principles outlined on page 103, you can
determine the direction of the market and use the right trading approach.
Don’t make the mistake of using only one trading approach. Learn to
identify whether a market is trending or not and adjust your trading strat egy accordingly.
Action Items:
 Pick any chart in any timeframe and practice drawing trendlines.
One of the most important skills of a trader is being able to iden tify the direction of the market. Practice on as many charts as
you can, until you can spot a trend within a couple of seconds.
 Select a trading approach that YOU are comfortable with. Make
sure that you understand what the indicator you are using is
measuring: WHY should you sell when it goes above 80? What
EXACTLY does it mean?
 Select a second trading approach. As you know you should have
one for a trending market and one for a market that is going
sideways. Which approach will you use when?
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 under “Selecting a Trad ing Style.”

140

Step 4: Defining Entry
Points

A

s you saw in the previous examples, most of the trading ap proaches or indicators already provide you with entry rules.
When defining entry points, you want to keep it simple and
specific. You can’t freeze the market. A market is constantly moving, and
you have to make your trading decisions fast.
Most trading approaches and indicators require a decision at the end of
the bar. Even when you’re watching 60 minute bars, and you’ve spent the
past hour doing nothing except waiting for your signal, now – at the end
of the bar – you only have a split second to make your decision.
Use as few entry rules as possible and be as specific as you can. The best
trading strategies have entry rules that you can specify in only two lines.
Action Items:
 Practice identifying the entry rules of the two approaches you se lected. Identify the underlying market condition (trending/
sideways) and apply the strategy you’ve selected. When should
you enter? Only mark the entry points. Don’t worry about exit
points yet.
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 and write down your
specific entry points under “Entry Signals.”

141

Step 5: Defining Exit
Points

T

his chapter is probably the most important chapter in the entire
book.

I once heard the saying: “A monkey can enter a trade, but money is made
(and lost) when you EXIT it.”
This couldn’t be truer. Most traders are right about the direction of the
market when they enter a trade, but they end up taking a loss because
they fail to capture profits at the right time.
Read this chapter again and again until you understand ALL of the con cepts outlined here. Knowing HOW and WHEN to exit a trade will ulti mately determine your success or failure as a trader.
There are three different exit rules you should apply:



Stop loss rules to protect your capital.



Profit-taking exits to realize your gains.



Time-stops to get you out of a trade and free your capital if the
market is not moving at all.

142

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Stop loss and profit-taking exit rules can be expressed in four ways:



A fixed dollar amount (e.g. $1,000)



A percentage of the current price (e.g. 1% of the entry price)



A percentage of the volatility (e.g. 50% of the average daily
movement)



Based on technical analysis (e.g. support and resistance levels)

In the following we’ll discuss these exit strategies in detail.
Stop Losses
A stop loss is used to limit the potential loss if the trade goes against you.
It’s the level at which you’ll close a trade on the basis that it has gone too
far in the 'wrong' direction, and, therefore, negated the reason for you
being in that trade.
Always use stop losses!
If you don't apply stop losses in your trading, you won't be trading for
long – you’ll end up wiping out your trading balance in no time. It can be
too easy for a $300 loss to become a $5,000 loss. A good trader will
know when to take a small loss and go on to the next trade.
I can’t stress this enough: even the most experienced traders have a stop
loss order in the market, whether they’re trading forex, futures, options,
or even stocks.
Remember that your trading capital is your business – if you burn it,
there’s no insurance. You’re done. Once you’ve entered a trade, immedi ately place a stop. This safeguards you from losing your entire account.

143

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Don’t Forget Your Stop Losses!
It's important to ensure that your stop is canceled if you close your posi tion. I mention this because I happen to know a trader who is very disci plined, who always enters a stop loss and a profit target order once he has
established a trade. A few years back, this trader suffered a number of
losses over the course of several days. So, naturally, he was quite happy
to see that a trade finally moved in his direction.
According to his strategy, his stop losses were very small and his profit
target was rather large, so if this trade reached the profit target, he would
make up for all the losses of the past couple of days PLUS bring in a
small profit on top of it.
And it happened: the market continued to move in his favor and he real ized a profit.
He was so happy that he jumped up from his chair, ran into the kitchen,
and told his wife all about the fantastic trade. FINALLY he had made
some money. They enjoyed a happy cup of coffee together, and he
couldn’t stop talking about his strategy, the trade, and how it paid off.
And when he returned to his computer an hour later, he found himself in
a losing position.
He couldn’t believe it! How had this happened?
After a few minutes, it dawned on him: he had forgotten to cancel his
stop loss. While he was celebrating his win, the market retraced and
filled his order, and then continued to go up.
The stop loss order was a sell order, and now the trader had a short posi tion in a rising market. All of his profits were gone.
The moral of the story:
Make SURE to cancel your orders, or use so-called “bracket orders,” or
“one-cancel-other (OCO) orders” for your profit target and stop loss.
Your broker can explain these terms to you in detail.

144

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
The most important thing, regardless of how you approach the decision,
is to know where you’ll cut a losing position BEFORE entering the trade.
Set the rules and ALWAYS follow them. With this in mind, let’s talk
about stop loss strategies.
Fixed Dollar Amount
Easy, fast, and simple. Just specify a dollar amount that you’re willing to
risk, subtract it from your entry price, and place a stop loss order.
How to Use This Strategy:
Simply subtract the dollar amount you specified from your entry price.
Example:
Let’s say you’re trading the EUR/USD currency pair. You entered the
market at 1.4585 and you want to risk $100. Since 1 pip (= 0.0001)
equals $10, you place your stop loss at 10 pips (= 0.0010) below your
entry price at 1.4575.

145

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Just as a reminder:
If you’re long a security, you’ll sell it in order to close the position. If
you’re short a security, you’ll buy it in order to close the position. I know
this sounds obvious, but you wouldn’t believe how many traders get con fused; instead of closing their position, they will add to their position.
It’s easy to make mistakes when the market starts moving fast and you
get nervous. Many traders use post-its after they’ve entered a trade: you
stick a ‘SELL’ post-it on your screen if you went long, and a ‘BUY’ postit if you went short. This way, you ensure that you’ll ALWAYS exit the
position as planned.
When to Use This Strategy:
This strategy is perfect for beginners, since you don’t have to perform
complex calculations. You simply add or subtract your stop loss to or
from your entry price and that’s it. It works best if you’re trading only
one stock or one market, and if the security doesn’t fluctuate too much.

146

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Percentage of the Current Price
How to Use This Strategy:
When applying this stop loss strategy, simply multiply the entry price by
(1 - your stop loss (in percent form)) to get your exit point.
Example:
If you’re trading the E-mini NASDAQ, and you’ve defined a 0.5% stop
loss, then you would multiply your entry price of 2151.75 by 0.995 (1 0.5%) for an exit point of 2141.

When to Use This Strategy:
You should apply this exit strategy if you’re trading multiple markets or
different stocks. You’ll find a more detailed explanation in the next sec tion: “Profit-Taking Exits.”

147

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Percentage of the Volatility
This exit strategy is another way to specify stop losses in volatile mar kets. The underlying idea is to adjust your stop loss based on the volatil ity of the market: you apply a larger stop loss in volatile markets and a
smaller stop loss in quiet markets.
How to Use This Strategy:
Using this profit exit strategy requires two steps:



First, you determine the average volatility of a market.
Second, multiply this number by the percentage you specified.

Example:
The average daily range in corn is $16. You can use the Average True
Range (ATR) function of your charting software to determine this num ber. Multiply it by the percentage you specified, e.g. 50%, and arrive at a
profit target of $8. Then, subtract $8 from your entry point amount.

When to Use This Strategy:
148

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
This strategy is perfect for markets with high changes in volatility, like
the grain markets. As you can see in the chart below, corn prices are
more volatile in summer months than in the winter.
Using Technical Analysis
Many traders like to use major support or resistance points on the chart
to determine their exits. Instead of support and resistance levels, you
could use Pivot Points, Fibonacci Levels, upper or lower levels of trend
channels, or Bollinger Bands, just to name a few.
How to Use This Strategy:
Simply use technical analysis to determine a potential stop loss.
Example:
In this example, we’re using a simple trendline to determine our stop
loss. The following chart is a 15 minute chart of Apple Computer
(AAPL). We wait for the first bar of the day, and as soon as we realize
that the stock is moving down over the first 15 minutes, we sell short at
$184.80. We draw a trendline from the previous day’s high to the high of
this morning’s bar and set our stop loss at the trendline, at $187.50.

149

The Complete Guide to Day Trading

When to Use This Strategy:
This strategy is perfect for traders who use technical analysis for their
entry points. If you’re using trendlines, indicators, or support and resis tance lines, placing your stop at these levels will seem very natural.

150

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Profit-Taking Exits
Once you’re in a profitable trade, the next challenge becomes when to
take that profit.
The main problem with taking profits is that, by our very nature, we hu mans (and especially traders) are greedy. After all, we want to make
money. A lot of money. And we want to make it fast. “Get rich quick,”
right?
This is a definite problem, and many traders are way too greedy. They
want to get rich on just one trade. And that’s when they lose.
Here’s the key to trading success: small profits, consistently.
Consistency is the key, because if your profits are consistent and predict able, then you can simply use leverage to trade size. Therefore you
MUST know when to exit with a profit.
Good traders use a stop loss; great traders use a profit target.
Here are some different types of exit strategies for profitable trades.

151

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Fixed Dollar Amount
This is the easiest way to exit a trade. Simply specify a dollar amount
that you would be happy with, add it to your entry point, and place a
profit target order in the market.
How to Use This Strategy:
Simply add the dollar amount you specified to your entry price.
Example:
Let’s say you’re trading 100 shares of IBM and enter at $110.13. Your
profit target is $100, so you would exit the trade as soon as prices move
up $1, to $111.13.
When to Use This Strategy:
This strategy works best if you are just trading one stock or one market,
and if the security doesn’t fluctuate too much.

152

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Percentage of the Current Price
How to Use This Strategy:
When applying this profit exit strategy, simply multiply the entry price
by (1 + your profit target (in percent)) to get your exit point.
Example:
If you’re trading IBM, and you’ve defined a 1% profit target, you would
multiply your entry price of $110.13 by 1.01 (1 + 1%) for an exit point of
$111.23.
When to Use This Strategy:
You should apply this exit strategy if you are trading multiple markets or
different stocks.
The reason is simple: let’s say you’re trading IBM and Ford. As I write
this, IBM is trading at $110.13 and Ford is trading at $6.72. As in the
previous example, let’s assume that you’re trading 100 shares each and
you want to make $100 per trade. IBM would only have to move 0.9% to
reach your profit target, but Ford shares would have to move almost 15%
in order to reach your profit target.
The following charts illustrate how easy it will be for IBM shares to
reach the target price, and how difficult it might be for Ford shares to do
so.

153

The Complete Guide to Day Trading

154

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
It would make more sense to specify your profit target as a percentage of
the price – e.g. 1%. In this case, IBM would have to move $1.1 and Ford
only $0.07 to reach the profit target.
The same applies to markets with a high volatility, like gold or energy
futures. In the beginning of 2007, gold was trading at $650. In November
of 2007, gold was trading 30% higher, at $850. A $20 move in gold
would have been 3% in January of 2007, but only 2.3% in November of
2007.

155

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Percentage of the Volatility
This exit strategy is another way to specify profit targets in volatile mar kets. The underlying idea is to adjust your profit target based on the
volatility of the market: you apply a higher profit target in volatile mar kets and a lower profit target in quiet markets.
How to Use This Strategy:
Using this profit exit strategy requires two steps:



First, you determine the average volatility of a market.
Second, multiply this number by the percentage you specified.

Please see the comments in the section on “Stop Losses” as an example.
When to Use This Strategy:
This strategy is perfect for commodity markets with high changes in
volatility, like the grain and energy markets.
Using Technical Analysis
Many traders like to use major support or resistance points on the chart
to determine their exits. Instead of support and resistance levels, you
could use Pivot Points, Fibonacci Levels, upper or lower levels of trend
channels, or Bollinger Bands, just to name a few.
How to Use This Strategy:
Use the process of technical analysis to determine a potential profit tar get.

156

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Example:
In this example, we’re using the previous day’s high and low as potential
profit targets. The following chart is a 15 minute chart of the E-mini
S&P. We wait for the first bar of the day, and, as soon as we realize that
the market has been moving up in the first 15 minutes, we enter at 1452.
We set our profit target at the previous day’s high – 1465.25 – for a total
profit of 13.25 points = $662.50. Later that day, we reach our profit tar get, and we could reverse the position by going short. Now we can use
the previous day low as a profit target and realize another profit of 21.75
points = $1,087.50.

When to Use This Strategy:
This strategy is perfect for markets that are moving sideways between
major support and resistance lines.

Trailing Stops
Trailing stops are “hybrid” stops. When entering a position, the trailing
stop is typically a stop loss, and as the trade moves in your favor, the
trailing stop becomes a profit exit.
The main difference between the exit strategies mentioned previously
and trailing stops is that you constantly adjust your stop while you’re in a
trade. All other exit strategies are “set-it-and-forget-it-strategies,” in
which you define stop loss and profit exit points the moment you enter
the trade, and then leave them alone until you close the trade.
How to Use This Strategy:
This strategy can be used in conjunction with technical analysis by plac ing the stop at support and resistance lines or – more simply – at the pre vious bar’s high or low. Another popular use of this strategy is placing
the stops at trend-following indicators like Moving Averages or
Parabolics. Some traders prefer using a fixed dollar amount.
Example 1: Fixed Dollar Amount:
If you were to set a straightforward $300 trailing stop, and the security
moved in your favor by $1,000, you could change your stop to only $300
behind the price and lock in $700 of profit.

158

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Example 2: Technical Analysis:
Below is a 60-minute chart of the E-mini S&P. Let’s say you went short
at 1502. You would place your trailing stop at the high of the current bar
at 1504. Once the next bar is completed, you move your stop to the high
of this bar to 1502.50. 60 minutes later, you move your stop to 1499, and
now your stop loss becomes a profit exit. Whatever happens to the trade
now, you’ll make at least 3 points (= $150). One hour later, you move
your stop to 1494.50.
So, when prices retrace, you’re stopped out at 1494.50 for a profit of 7.5
points (= $375).

When to Use This Strategy:
This strategy is perfect for trending markets. You should use this strategy
to take advantage of longer-lasting trends. Keep in mind that this strategy
requires your constant attention, since you MUST move your trailing
stops according to your rules.

159

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Taking Partial Profits
Nobody ever lost money taking profits.
You can combine the strategies outlined above for more sophisticated
exit strategies. As an example, you could close half of your position once
you’ve achieved a fixed dollar amount in profits, and let the other half
continue to trade to the next support or resistance level.
Or you could take 1/3 of your profits at a predefined profit target, take
another 1/3 at the next support or resistance level, and then apply a trail ing stop to the remaining 1/3.
The possibilities are endless. That’s why many professional traders focus
on perfecting their exit strategy. In contrast, many amateur traders and
beginners tend to focus on entry strategies.
Don’t make the same mistake. Once you’ve defined sound entry rules,
test different exit strategies to optimize your profits.
Time-Stops
A time-stop gets you out of a trade if it’s not moving in any direction.
You probably have a good reason for entering a trade. So, immediately
after entering, you apply your stop loss and your profit target and wait.
And wait. And wait. And nothing happens.
Time to bail out. If prices do not move at all, get out.
How to Use This Strategy:
Simply specify a “time-out,” after which you will exit the market. Then
set a timer and exit the trade after the specified time, regardless of
whether you reached your stop loss or profit target.

160

Step 5: Defining Exit Points
Example:
A good time-stop is three times the timeframe you’re using. If you’re
using 15-minute charts, you might want to abandon the trade if neither
your profit nor your stop loss is hit after 45 minutes. If you’re using 60
minute charts, get out after 3 hours.
When to Use This Strategy:
Always! Whatever the reason behind your entry signal, you want to see
something happen. If nothing happens after a certain amount of time, the
underlying assumption of your entry may be wrong. If you stay in the
trade, then you’re gambling not trading.
As traders, we want to make money fast. The longer you have your
money in the market, the longer it’s at risk. You can dramatically reduce
the risk by applying a time-stop and exiting the market if it doesn’t
move. Free your capital and take the next trading opportunity. Don’t
gamble!
Action Items:
 Practice your exit rules: by now you should already be able to
spot your entry points. Once you’ve determined your entry point
on a chart, apply your stop loss rule and your profit-taking rule
to determine your exit points.
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 and write down your
specific exit points under “Exit Signals.”

161

Step 6: Evaluating Your
Strategy

O

nce you’ve determined which markets you want to trade, se lected a timeframe, and defined your entry and exit rules, it’s
time to test and evaluate your trading strategy.

There are three ways to test your trading strategy:



Back-Testing
Back-testing is a method of testing which will run your strategy
against prior time periods. Basically, you’re performing a simu lation: you use your strategy with relevant past data to test its ef fectiveness. By using the historical data, you’re saving a ton of
time; if you tried to test your strategy by applying it to the time
periods yet to come, it might take you years.
Back-testing is used for a variety of strategies, including those
based on technical analysis. The effectiveness of back-testing
relies on the theory that what has happened in the past WILL
happen again in the future. Also, keep in mind that your backtesting results are quite dependent on the moves that occurred in
the tested time period. It’s important to remember that this in creases the potential of risk for your strategy.

162

Step 6: Evaluating Your Strategy



The Monte-Carlo Simulation
The Monte-Carlo Simulation is a problem-solving technique
used to approximate the probability of certain outcomes by run ning multiple trial runs – called simulations – using random vari ables. It is a way to account for the randomness in a trading pa rameter – typically, the sequence of trades. In Monte Carlo
simulations, the basic idea is to take a sequence of trades gener ated by a trading system, randomize the order of trades, and cal culate the rate of return and the maximum drawdown, assuming
that x% of the account is risked on each trade.
The process is repeated several hundred times, each time using a
different random sequence of the same trades. You can then pose
a question such as "If 5% of the account is risked on each trade,
what is the probability that the maximum drawdown will be less
than 25%?" If 1,000 random sequences of trades are simulated
with 5% risk, for example, and 940 of them have a maximum
drawdown of less than 25%, then you could say the probability
of achieving a maximum drawdown of less than 25% is 94%
(940/1,000).
Keep in mind that the data used in Monte Carlo Simulations is
still historical data; therefore, one could say that this simulation
is a more sophisticated way of back-testing.



Paper Trading
Paper trading is a method of “risk-free” trading. Basically, you
set up a dummy account, through which you can test your trad ing strategy with paper money. There are two methods to this:
you can either pretend to buy and sell stocks, bonds, commodi ties, etc., and keep track of your profits and losses on paper, or
you can open an account online, usually through your broker
(and usually for free).
This is a fantastic way for new traders to kill a whole tree full of
birds with one stone. First off, you’ll learn the tricks of the trade
without putting your own money at risk. Second, you’ll be able
to gain some much-needed confidence when it comes to maneu 163

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
vering in the markets. And third, you’ll be able to test out your
trading strategy in real-time simulation.
This is probably the best way to test a trading strategy, since it
doesn’t rely on historical data. On the other hand, it’s the most
time-consuming strategy, since it might take weeks or months
until you have enough data for a statistically relevant perform ance report.
How long should you back-test a trading strategy?
The more trades you use in your back-testing, the higher the probability
that your trading strategy will succeed in the future. Look at the follow ing table:

Number of Trades

50

100

200 300

500

<>Margin of Error

14%

10%

7%

4%

6%

More trades mean a smaller margin of error, resulting in a higher pre dictability of future performance.
Somebody with a Ph.D. in statistics once told me that you need at least
40 trades in order to produce statistically relevant results.
So, the question “How long should you test your trading strategy?” de pends on the trade frequency.
How many trades per day does your trading strategy generate? If your
strategy generates three trades per day (i.e. 15 trades per week), then you
might get decent results after three weeks of testing. But if your trading
strategy generates only three trades per month (i.e. 36 trades per year),
then you should test your strategy for at least one year to receive reliable
data results.
When testing a strategy, keep in mind that markets change.

164

Step 6: Evaluating Your Strategy
Let me use the E-mini S&P as an example. In 2000, the average daily
range was 100-150 ticks per day; in 2004, it was only 40-60 ticks per
day.
If you back-test any trend-following day trading system in the E-mini
S&P, you’ll see that it worked perfectly until 2002, and then, suddenly, it
fell apart. It seems that there were no more intraday trends. That's not
surprising as the daily range of the E-mini S&P decreased by more than
50%.
What happened?
There are a couple of plausible explanations. Probably the best and most
important one is the introduction of the Pattern Day Trading Rule in Au gust and September of 2001, by the NYSE and NASD. If a trader exe cutes four or more day trades within a five-business-day period then he
must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in his margin account at all
times. Because of this rule, traders stopped day trading equities and
started trading the E-mini S&P futures instead.
Look at this graph showing the sudden increase in volume in the E-mini
S&P in the beginning of 2001.
Many of these stock day traders used methods to scalp the market for a
few pennies. Using the E-mini S&P, they suddenly had a much higher
leverage and paid fewer commissions, and their methods were extremely
profitable.
Unfortunately, these scalping methods kill an intraday trend almost in stantly, making almost every trend-following approach fail.
Another reason for the dramatic change of the market was the introduc tion of the automated strategy execution in TradeStation. In 2002, the
TradeStation customers who were using this feature increased by 268%.
Overbought/oversold strategies became very popular, and when the mar ket made an attempt to trend, these strategies immediately established a
contrary position.

165

The Complete Guide to Day Trading

Conclusion
When back-testing, there are definitely things you need to be aware of.
It's not enough to just run a strategy on as much data as possible; it's im portant to know the underlying market conditions.
As outlined in previous chapters: in non-trending markets, you need to
use trend-fading systems; and, in trending markets, you should use trendfollowing methods.
That's when clever back-testing helps you. If your back-testing tells you
that a trend-following method worked in 2000-2002, but doesn't work in
2003 and 2004, then you should not use this strategy right now. And vice
versa: when you see that a trend-fading method produced nice profits in
2003, 2004, and 2005, then trade it.

166

Step 6: Evaluating Your Strategy
How to Read and Understand a Performance Report
While testing your trading strategy, you should keep detailed records of
the wins and losses in order to produce a performance report. Many
software packages can help you with that, but a simple excel sheet will
do the trick just as well.
If you get in contact with us here at Rockwell Trading®, we can send
you an excel sheet that will automatically produce a performance report
for you after you’ve entered several trades.
Here’s an example of a performance report:

Total (Net) Profit
The first figure to look for is the total, or net, profit. Obviously you want
your system to generate profits, but don’t be frustrated when, during the
development stage, your trading system shows a loss; try to reverse your
entry signals.
167

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
You might have heard that trading is a zero sum game. If you want to buy
something (e.g. a certain stock or futures contract), then somebody else
needs to sell it to you. And, you can only sell a position if somebody else
is willing to buy from you at the price you're asking.
This means that if you lose money on a trade, then the person who took
the other side of the trade is MAKING money. And vice versa: if you’re
making money on a trade, then the other trader is losing money. In the
markets, money is not "generated." It just changes hands.
So, if you’re going long at a certain price level, and you lose, then try to
go short instead. Many times this is the easiest way to turn a losing sys tem into a winning one.
Average Profit per Trade
The next figure you want to look at is the average profit per trade. Make
sure this number is greater than slippage and commissions, and that it
makes your trading worthwhile. Trading is all about risk and reward, and
you want to make sure you get a decent reward for your risk.
Winning Percentage
Many profitable trading systems achieve a nice net profit with a rather
small winning percentage, sometimes even below 30%. These systems
follow the principle: “Cut your losses short and let your profits run.”
However, YOU need to decide whether you can stand 7 losers and only 3
winners in 10 trades. If you want to be “right” most of the time, then you
should pick a system with a high winning percentage.
Understanding Winning Percentage
Let's say you purchased or developed a system that has a winning per centage of 70%.
What exactly does that mean?
168

Step 6: Evaluating Your Strategy
It means that the probability of having a winning trade is 70% – i.e. it is
more likely that the trade you are currently in turns out to be a winner
rather than a loser.
Does that mean that when you trade 10 times you will have 7 winners?
No!
It means that if you trade long enough (i.e. at least 40 trades) then you
will have more winners than losers. But it doesn’t guarantee that after 3
losers in a row, you’ll have a winner.
Example:
If you toss a coin then you have 2 possible outcomes: heads or tails. The
probability for each is 50% – i.e. when you toss the coin 4 times, then
you should get 2 heads and 2 tails.
But what if you tossed the coin 3 times and you got heads 3 times?
What is the probability of heads on the fourth coin toss?
50%, or less?
If you answered 'less,' than you fell for a common misconception. The
probability of getting heads again is still 50%. No more and no less.
But many traders think that the probability of tails is higher now because
the three previous coin tosses resulted in heads. Some traders might even
increase their bet because they are convinced that now “tails is overdue.”
Statistically, this assumption is nonsense; it’s a dangerous – and many
times costly – misconception.
Let's get back to our trading example: if you have a winning percentage
of 70%, and you had 9 losers in a row, what’s the probability of having a
winner now? It's still 70% (and therefore there's still a 30% chance of a
loser).

169

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Average Winning Trade and Average Losing Trade
The average winning trade should be bigger than the average losing
trade. If you can keep your wins larger than your losses, then you’ll make
money even if you just have a 50% winning percentage. And every
trader should be able to achieve that. If you can’t, reverse your entry sig nals as described previously.
Profit Factor
Take a look at the Profit Factor (Gross Profit / Gross Loss). This will tell
you how many dollars you’re likely to win for every dollar you lose. The
higher the profit factor, the better the system. A system should have a
profit factor of 1.5 or more, but watch out when you see profit factors
above 3.0, because it might be that the system is over-optimized.
.
Maximum Drawdown
The maximum drawdown is the lowest point your account reaches be tween peaks.
Let me explain:
Imagine that you start your trading account with $10,000, and, after a
few trades, you lose $2,000. Your drawdown would be 20%.
Now, let's say you make more trades and gain $4,000, which brings you
to $12,000 ($8,000 + $4,000 = $12,000). And after this, on the next
trade, you lose $2,000. Your drawdown would be 16.7% ($12,000 $2,000). The $12,000 was your equity peak; that was the highest point in
the period we looked at.
If you started your account with $10,000 and the lowest amount you had
in your account over a six-month period was $5,000, then you had a 50%
drawdown.

170

Step 6: Evaluating Your Strategy
You would need to make $5,000 from the lowest point in order to recoup
your losses. Even though you lost 50% from your high of $10,000, you
would need to make 100% on the $5,000 to get back to your original
amount.
Measuring Drawdown Recovery:
Drawdown recovery can confuse many traders. If a trader loses 20% of
his account, he thinks he needs to make 20% in order to get back to even.
This isn’t true. If you started with $10,000 and lost $2,000 (20%), you
would need to make 25% in order to get back to even. The difference
between $8,000 and $10,000 is $2,000. If you calculate the $2,000 as a
percentage of $8,000 (not the original $10,000) it works out to 25%.
A famous trader once said: “If you want your system to double or triple
your account, you should expect a drawdown of up to 30% on your way
to trading riches.” Not every trader can stand a 30% drawdown.
Look at the maximum drawdown that your strategy has produced so far,
and double it. If you can stand this drawdown, then you’ve found the
right strategy.
Why double it? Remember: your worst drawdown is always ahead of
you. It’s best to plan for it now.
Conclusion
The above examples provide you with some guidelines, but it’s up to you
to decide whether the numbers in the strategy’s performance report work
for you or don’t.
Ultimately, YOU’RE the one trading the strategy, and YOU’RE the one
who has to feel comfortable with the expected results of your strategy.

171

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Action Items:
 Start back-testing your trading plan on at least 40 trades. The
more trades the better. You can download an excel sheet to re cord your trades from our website:
www.thecompleteguidetodaytrading.com
 Analyze the performance report and decide if YOU feel comfort able with the statistics.
 Continue your trading plan on page 245 and write down your ex pectations for your trading strategy based on the results of your
back-testing.

172

Step 7: Improving Your
Strategy

T

here is a difference between “improving” and “curve-fitting” a
system. You can improve your system by testing different exit
methods. If you’re using a fixed stop, try a trailing stop instead.
Add a time-stop and evaluate the results again.
Don’t look only at the net profit; look also at the profit factor, the aver age
profit per trade, and the maximum drawdown. Many times, you’ll see
that the net profit slightly decreases when you add different stops, but the
other figures might improve dramatically.
Don’t fall into the trap of over-optimizing: you can eliminate almost all
losers by adding enough rules, but your resulting strategy will be almost
worthless.

173

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Example:
If you see that on Tuesdays, you have more losers than on the other
weekdays, you might be tempted to add a “filter” that prevents your sys tem from entering trades on Tuesdays.
Next, you find that in January, you have much worse results than in other
months, so you add a filter that enters trades only between February and
December.
You add more and more filters to avoid losses, and eventually you end up
with a trading rule like this, which I just saw recently:
IF FVE > -1 And Regression Slope (Close , 35) / Close.35 *
100 > -.35 And Regression Slope (Close , 35) / Close.35 *
100 < .4 And Regression Slope (Close , 70) / Close.70 * 100
> -.4 And Regression Slope (Close , 70) / Close.70 * 100 < .
4 And Regression Slope (Close , 170) / Close.170 * 100 >
-.2 And MACD Diff (Close , 12 , 26 , 9) > -.003 And Not
Tuesday And Not Day Of Month = 12 and not Month =
August and Time > 9:30 ...
Though you’ve eliminated all possibilities of losing (in the past) and this
trading system is now producing fantastic profits in your testing, it’s very
unlikely that it will continue to do so when it hits reality.
Determine the “Best” Parameter Without Curve-Fitting a Strategy
The underlying strategy in this example is a simple breakout strategy.
The strategy contains a parameter called TF_Param.
I’ll explain how we optimized the parameter, and why we selected 0.3 as
the current value for the parameter. I used Genesis Financial Trade
Navigator (www.genesisft.com) to produce the test results and the fol lowing graphics.

174

Step 7: Improving Your Strategy
First, I run the optimization and look at the net profit, since that’s one of
the most important figures:

As you can see, a parameter between 0.25 and 0.7 produces robust re sults.

175

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Next I am looking at the max drawdown.

Any parameter between 0.25 and 0.5 produces a rather low drawdown,
so using the combined information, I would pick a TF_Param between
0.25 and 0.5.

176

Step 7: Improving Your Strategy
Now, I’m looking at the average profit per trade:

A parameter between 0.25 and 0.7 produces a decent average profit per
trade, so the current selection of TF_Param between 0.25 and 0.5 is still a
good choice.

177

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Now, I’m looking at the winning percentage. The higher, the better:

Again a value of 0.25 to 0.7 for the variable TF_Param produces the best
results. We leave our range for TF_Param between 0.25 and 0.5

178

Step 7: Improving Your Strategy
As a last test, we look at the number of trades. Again, the higher, the
better.

No surprises here: the lower the parameter, the more trades we get. A
parameter value below 0.45 leads to the highest amount of trades.
Conclusion
By combining all the previous findings, we see that a TF_Param between
0.25 and 0.4 produces the best results.
That’s why 0.3 is definitely a good choice. Even if the market changes
slightly, the system would still produce excellent results.

179

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Action Items:
 Try to improve your trading strategy by varying the parameters.
As an example: if you used 14 bars in the RSI, try 10, 12, 14, 16,
18, and 20 bars.
 Try to improve your strategy by modifying the stops.
Example: use a volatility stop instead of a fixed stop loss.
 Do the same with your profit targets. I know that this is timeconsuming, but the good news is, once it’s done correctly, you
won’t have to do it again for a very long time. I have been using
the same trading strategy for four years now.

The 10 Power Principles –
Making Sure That Your
Trading Plan Works

H

aving a trading plan is like having a solid blueprint to build
your home, or having a map when traveling to a new location.
You already know that a professional trader won’t survive in
the markets without a good trading plan.
In the previous step, you learned:






How to define your financial and trading goals.
How to select the right market for your trading goals.
What timeframe you should trade in.
Different trading styles and how to find the right one for you.
How to create a basic trading plan.

Now that you’ve defined your goals and created your trading plan, you
need to make sure it really works. Thus far, everything might look great,
but how can you be sure that the system works when you start trading it
with real money?
Evaluating a trading strategy is easier than you think. In this chapter,
you'll find 10 Principles of Successful Trading Strategies that we’ve
developed and refined over the last couple of years.

181

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
You should use these Power Principles to evaluate your trading strategy,
whether you developed it on your own or are thinking about purchasing
one. By checking a strategy against these principles, you can dramati cally increase your chances of success.
Principle #1: Use Few Rules – Make It Easy to Understand
It may surprise you that the best trading systems have less than ten rules.
The more rules you have, the more likely that you’ve "curve-fitted" your
trading strategy to past data, and such an over-optimized system is very
unlikely to produce profits in real markets.
It's important that your rules are easy to understand and execute. The
markets can behave very wildly and move very fast, and you won't have
time to calculate complicated formulas in order to make a trading deci sion. Think about successful floor traders: the only tool they use is a cal culator, and they make thousands of dollars every day.
Example:
Take a look at the trading approaches presented in the section “Popular
Trading Approaches.” The easy rules are: buy when the RSI drops below
a reading of 20, or, sell when prices move above the upper Bollinger
Band.
Avoid a trading strategy that has an entry rule like this:
Buy when the RSI is below 20, and the ADX is between 7 and 12,
and the 7-bar moving average is pointing up more than 45 de grees, and there is a convergence between the price bars and the
MACD, and, and, and…
Do you really think that you could follow this strategy while you’re
watching the markets LIVE?

182

__The 10 Power Principles – Making Sure That Your Trading Plan Works
Principle #2: Trade Electronic and Liquid Markets
I strongly recommend that you trade electronic markets, because com missions are lower and you receive instant fills. You need to know as fast
as possible if your order was filled and at what price, because you plan
your exit based on this information.
You should never place an exit order before you know that your entry
order is filled. When you trade open outcry markets (non-electronic), you
might have to wait awhile before you receive your fill. By that time, the
market might have already turned and your profitable trade has turned
into a loss!
When trading electronic markets, you receive your fills in less than one
second and can immediately place your exit orders. Trading liquid mar kets means you can avoid slippage, which will save you hundreds or
even thousands of dollars.
Fortunately, more and more markets are now traded electronically. The
recent addition of the grain futures markets in the summer of 2006 was a
huge success: in January of 2007, the volume traded in the electronic
contracts surpassed the volume traded in the pit markets. In December of
2007, the pit-traded corn contract traded with 621,800 contracts, while
the electronic corn contract had a trading volume of 2,444,400 contracts.
Most futures markets, all forex currency pairs, and the major U.S. stock
markets are trading electronically.
So why would you even want to trade Pork Bellies or Lumber?
Principle #3: Have Realistic Expectations
Losses are part of our business. A trading system that doesn't have losses
is "too good to be true." Recently, I ran into a trading system with a
whopping winning percentage of 91% and a drawdown of less than $500.
WOW!

183

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
When I looked at the details, though, it turned out that the system was
only tested on 87 trades and – of course – it was curve-fitted. If you run
across a trading system with numbers too good to be true, then it's proba bly exactly THAT: too good to be true.
Usually you can expect the following from a robust trading system:





A winning percentage of 60-80%
A profit factor of 1.3-2.5
A maximum drawdown of 10-20% of the yearly profit

Use these numbers as a rough guideline, and you’ll easily identify curvefitted systems.
Principle #4: Maintain a Healthy Balance Between Risk and
Reward
Let me give you an example: if you go to a casino and bet everything
you have on "red," then you have a 49% chance of doubling your money
and a 51% chance of losing everything. The same applies to trading: you
can make a lot of money if you’re risking a lot, but if you do, the risk of
ruin is also high. You need to find a healthy balance between risk and
reward.
Make sure your trading strategy is using small stop losses and that your
profit targets are bigger than your stop losses.
Stay away from strategies that have a small profit target of only $100 and
a stop loss of $2,000. Sure, the winning percentage will be fantastic, but
2-3 losses in a row can wipe out your trading account.
The perfect balance between risk and reward is 1:1.5 or more – i.e. for
every dollar you risk you should be able to make at least $1.50.
In other words, if you apply a stop loss of $100, your profit target should
be at least $150.

__The 10 Power Principles – Making Sure That Your Trading Plan Works
Principle #5: Find a System That Produces at Least Five
Trades per Week
The higher your trading frequency, the smaller your chances of having a
losing month. If you have a trading strategy that has a winning percent age of 70%, but only produces one trade per month, then one loser is
enough to have a losing month. In this example, you could have several
losing months in a row before you finally start making profits.
In the meantime, how do you pay your bills?
If your trading strategy produces five trades per week, then you have on
average 20 trades per month. If you have a winning percentage of 70%,
then your chances of a winning month are extremely high.
And that's the goal of all traders: having as many winning months as
possible!
Principle #6: Start Small – Grow Big
Your trading system should allow you to start small and grow big. A
good trading system allows you to start with one or two contracts, in creasing your position as your trading account grows.
This is in contrast to many "martingale" trading systems, which require
increasing position sizes when you are in a losing streak.
You’ve probably heard about this strategy: double your contracts every
time you lose, and one winner will win back all the money you previ ously lost.

185

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Let’s take a look at the following table. It assumes that you are risking
$100 per trade and then doubling up after each losing trade.
Your First Trade
Second Trade
Third Trade
Fourth Trade
Fifth Trade
Sixth Trade
Seventh Trade
Eighth Trade
Ninth Trade
Tenth Trade
Your Total Loss

$100

1 contract or 100 shares

$200

2 contracts or 200 shares

$400

4 contracts or 400 shares

$800

8 contracts or 800 shares

$1,600

16 contracts or 1,600 shares

$3,200

32 contracts or 3,200 shares

$6,400

64 contracts or 6,400 shares

$12,800

128 contracts or 12,800 shares

$25,600

256 contracts or 25,600 shares

$51,200

512 contracts or 51,200 shares

$102,300

1,024 contracts or
102,400 shares

As you can see from the chart, the losses are not really the problem; the
main problem is the amount of contracts or shares that you’re trading.
It's not unusual to have 4-5 losing trades in a row, and this strategy would
already require you to trade 16 contracts, or 1,600 shares, of a stock after
just 4 losses! If you’re trading the E-mini S&P, you would need an
account size of at least $63,200, just to meet the margin re quirements.
And, if we assume that you’re trading stocks around $100 (e.g. IBM or
Apple), then you would need $160,000 in your account.

186

__The 10 Power Principles – Making Sure That Your Trading Plan Works
Now, you may ask how likely this type of situation actually is. The an swer: very likely. That was the entire point of the previous few pages.
Just think back to the example with the coins: an atypical negative trad ing run CAN and WILL happen.
This is why I do not recommend doubling up after each loss. If we trade
in a disciplined, systematic manner, then when our atypical run DOES
occur, we will still be in the game at the end of it.
Regardless of the strategy or method you use to trade, there will be occa sions when you have losses, or even a string of losses. When these occur,
it’s important to have faith in your trading plan; don’t try to double up
your trades to “catch up” on your wins.
The main point I want to make here is that every trading system you find
will go through times when it has more losses than wins.
This is to be expected, and it’s where effective money management
comes into play.
Principle #7: Automate Your Exits
Emotions and human errors are the most common mistakes that traders
make. You have to avoid these mistakes by any means necessary, espe cially when the market starts to move fast. You might experience panic
and indecision, but if you give in to those emotions, you’ll suffer a much
greater loss than you had originally planned for.
Your exit points should be easy to determine. The best solution for your
exit points is the use of “bracket orders.” Most trading platforms offer
bracket orders, which allow you to attach a profit target and a stop loss to
your entry.
This way, you can put your trade on autopilot, and the trading system
will close your position at the specified levels.
Of course, this assumes that you have easy exit rules. A stop loss of
$100, or 1%, of the entry price can easily be specified in today’s trading
platforms.
187

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Exit rules like “2/3 of the average true range of the past 5 trading days”
are more complex to automate. In the beginning, you should keep your
trading as simple as possible.
If you can’t make money with simple entry and exit points, you won’t be
able to make money with more complex trading rules. Think about driv ing a car: if you can’t drive a Ford, you definitely won’t be able to drive
a Ferrari.
Principle #8: Have a High Percentage of Winning Trades
Your trading strategy should produce more winners than 50%. There's no
doubt that trading strategies with smaller winning percentages can be
profitable, too, but the psychological pressure is enormous.
Taking 7 losers out of 10 trades, and not doubting that system, takes a
great deal of discipline, and many traders can't stand the pressure. After
the sixth loser, they’ll start "improving" the strategy, or stop trading it
completely.
It’s very helpful for beginning or novice traders to gain confidence in
their trading, and if your strategy gives you a high winning percentage,
let’s say more than 65%, your confidence will definitely be on the rise.
Principle #9: Test Your Strategy on at Least 200 Trades
The more trades you use in your back-testing (without curve-fitting), the
higher the probability that your trading strategy will succeed in the fu ture. Look at the following table:

Number of Trades

50

100

200 300

500

<>Margin of Error

14%

10%

7%

4%

6%

The more trades you have in your back-testing, the smaller the margin of
error, and the higher the probability of producing profits in the future.
188

__The 10 Power Principles – Making Sure That Your Trading Plan Works
You need at least 40 trades for a valid performance report. As you can
see from the table above, 200 trades are optimal, since the margin of er ror decreases fast from 14% to 7% with only an addition 150 trades.
If you test your system on more than 200 trades, the margin of error de creases at a slower rate. The next 100 trades only increase the confidence
by 2%.
Principle #10: Choose a Valid Back-Testing Period
I recently saw the following ad:
"Since 1994, I've taught thousands of traders worldwide a
simple and reliable E-mini trading methodology."
That's a very interesting claim…
The E-mini S&P was introduced in September of 1997, and the E-mini
NASDAQ was introduced in June of 1999; therefore, NONE of these
contracts existed before 1997.
Regardless, though, we only have to worry about the age of the contracts
for back-testing purposes. And, if you develop an E-mini S&P trading
strategy, then you should only back-test it for the past 3-4 years anyway.

189

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
This is because, even though the contract has existed since 1997, there
was practically nobody trading it (see the following chart):

The same applies to strategies for the grain futures: they were introduced
in August of 2006. Do not make the mistake of back-testing your trading
strategy on the pit contract. When futures contracts start trading elec tronically, they attract a different kind of trader than their pit-traded
counterparts; therefore, the characteristics of the two markets can be
very, very different.
It would be foolish to think that the markets remain the same once they
can be electronically traded. Faster fills and lower commissions allow a
different kind of trading strategy, and the markets WILL behave differ ently than during the times when only pit traders traded them.

The Secrets to Day
Trading Success

There’s More To Trading
Than Just Having a
Strategy

C

ongratulations. You made it to the third part of the book. You’ve
learned about the basics of day trading and you know how to
develop a profitable trading strategy.

You understand that a good trading strategy is one of the single most im portant factors when it comes to your trading.
With a proven, reliable strategy, you'll have a map for your trading future
and a guideline for your success. You'll have a plan. Believe me, most
traders out there just open a trading account and start trading, without a
clue as to what they’re getting themselves into. Only a few of them have
a trading strategy, and because of that, many of them fail.
In fact, the vast majority of them fail. According to a report from the
North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA):
“Only 11.5% [of traders] might profitably trade [the markets].
At least 70% of traders lose money in the markets…70% of pub lic traders will not only lose, but will almost certainly lose
everything they invest.”
At least 70% will lose everything they invest. And only 11.5% of traders
will actually succeed. That’s just slightly over 1 in 10. Not great odds.
193

The Complete Guide to Day Trading

But, if you’ve followed the action items outlined throughout the previous
chapters, then you should have a trading strategy mapped out. And, if
you do, then that small step has dramatically increased your chances of
belonging to the 11.5% of successful traders out there who are actually
making money.
But here's the thing about trading strategies: they're a dime a dozen.
These days, you can find hundreds of books with different trading strate gies, along with countless websites that offer trading strategies for free.
In addition, you’ll find “the trading strategy of the month” every couple
of weeks in nearly every trading industry magazine out there.
So, if there are so many trading strategies available, why do only 11.5%
of traders make money?
The problem is that strategies do NOT make a good trader. There’s
more to trading that just having a strategy. Only time, knowledge, ex perience, and guidance can make you the trader you want to be.

194

There’s More To Trading Than Just Having a Strategy
The Ralph Vince Experiment
Ralph Vince is a well-respected and well-known financial investor and
educator. He's published a number of books on trading and the trading
industry, and he also performed a very famous experiment known as the
Ralph Vince Experiment.
Mr. Vince took 40 Ph.D.s and set them up to trade with a computer game.
Now, these 40 people all had doctorates, but Mr. Vince made sure that
none of their doctorates involved any sort of background in statistics or
trading. In the game, each of them were given $1,000 and 100 trades,
with a 60% winning percentage. When they won, they won the amount
of money they risked. When they lost, they lost the amount of money
they risked. Simple. As you can see, ALL of them had a profitable trad ing strategy.
So, after all 40 had completed their 100 trades, how many do you think
made money?
2.
Only 2 doctorates out of 40 were able to make money. The other 38
failed to succeed.
Source: CSI News Journal, March 1992

Those are pretty convincing statistics. 95% of the candidates lost out.
And why? Because they fell into the age-old traps: poor money man agement, gambler's fallacy, and lack of discipline, guidance, and experi ence.
Did they have a profitable trading strategy? Of course!
Remember, each one of the traders took 100 trades with a 60% winning
percentage. Mr. Vince gave them a profitable trading strategy to use, but
they still couldn’t succeed.

195

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
So, it seems that there is definitely more to trading than just having a
strategy. And that’s exactly what you’ll learn about in this section of the
book:

success.

The Seven Mistakes of
Traders and How to Avoid
Them

S

o, let’s examine why traders fail. If you know the pitfalls of trad ing, then it becomes easier to avoid them. In this chapter, we’ll
talk about the mistakes that traders make and how you can avoid

them.

First off, there are two types of mistakes that a trader can make:



The small ones
The big ones

Yes, you’ll definitely make small mistakes along the way – I guarantee it.
You might buy a security when you intended to sell it, simply because
you pushed the wrong button. Or maybe you’ll buy the wrong stock, just
because there’s a typo when you enter the symbol. Another possibility is
placing the wrong order because you enter a buy order at $213.5 instead
of $21.35. These types of things have happened to all of us.
They’re small mistakes, and they’re “forgivable.” With a little bit of luck,
you might even be able to profit from them.
However, there are big mistakes that you absolutely MUST avoid if
you’re going to be a successful trader.

197

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
For instance, one of the biggest trading mistakes that you could ever
make is to try to learn and understand everything about trading…and
then never actually START to trade.
I know many aspiring traders who have read countless books, have de veloped dozens of trading strategies, and who have analyzed a number of
markets; but they’ve failed to pull the trigger when it comes to real trad ing. As you know, part of your education is your knowledge and your
experience. If you want to make money with trading, then eventually you
have to take the plunge and get started.
Yes, I know: there’s a chance of losing some money. That’s true. When
you trade, you're taking a risk. (If you want to know how to start trading
without risking any of your own money, please read the chapter “How to
Start Trading Without Risking a Single Penny,” on page 235).
What Exactly Is “Risk?”
Risk means “not having control.”
Example: If you’re driving a car on the highway, then you're at risk. It’s
as simple as that. But, thankfully, there are certain things we can do to
control that risk:
 All motorists are required to have a formal education and success fully test their driving skills before they are allowed to drive a car.
This qualification process is called getting a driver’s license.
 Cars are equipped with certain security features, such as seat belts,
airbags, anti-brake systems, and – let’s not forget – a steering wheel,
which enables you to navigate around obstacles in your path.
 When you’re new to driving, you usually practice with another per son (e.g. your parent) in an empty parking lot BEFORE hitting the
road. You start driving at 10 mph, and then, as you grow more com fortable, you can slowly increase the speed. When you’re confident
in your abilities, you’ll most likely leave the parking lot for the open
road (but let’s not move too fast – probably a country road, with no
traffic!)
198

The Seven Mistakes of Traders and How to Avoid Them
All of these things help you control the risk when it comes to driving.
You’ll never be able to eliminate the risk completely, but you can take
appropriate action to reduce it.
The same principles apply in trading:
 You should have a formal education and prove your skills before you
start to trade. Unfortunately, there are no tests required before you
can open a brokerage account, but you should take the time to learn
about the markets and develop a strategy before you “hit the open
road.”
 When trading, you can also apply certain “security features.” Two of
the most important are having a trading strategy and using stop
losses.
 When you’re new to trading, you should paper trade first (see page
235). Then, after you’ve built up some confidence, you can start
trading with one lot/contract, or 100 shares. If you’re comfortable
and you achieve acceptable results, then you can increase the con tract or share size.
And never trade with money you can’t afford to lose. Get your current
financial situation in order first, and THEN start trading.
Get your credit cleaned up, pay off high interest loans and credit cards,
and put at least three months of living expenses in savings. Once this is
done, you’re ready to start letting your money work for you.
Don’t trade to get rich quick.
That’s the number one principle when it comes to controlling your risk.
If day trading was easy, everyone in the world would be doing the same
thing: trading like crazy every day and becoming insanely rich by night fall!

199

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
We both know it’s NOT easy. So let’s take a look at the seven “deadly”
trading mistakes. These are the challenges that every trader faces, and
they’re the ones which usually cost traders a whole lot of money.
Being aware of these challenges is the first step in avoiding them. Think
about the car driving example again: if you know that driving on icy
roads is dangerous, you can try to avoid traveling in that particular
weather condition. But, if you don’t know about ice and the hazard it
poses, you might just get into your car and drive like normal. You won’t
even realize the danger until you feel your vehicle slipping right off the
road.
The same principle applies in trading: being aware of the possible mis takes and pitfalls will help you to avoid them.
Mistake #1: Struggling To Identify the Direction of the Market
Traders use very complicated formulas, indicators, and systems to iden tify a trend. They’ll plot so many indicators on the screen that they can’t
even see the prices anymore.
They think that the more complicated a system is, the better it should
“predict” the trends.
As a result, they completely lose sight of the basic principle: buy when
the market is going up and sell when the market is going down.
About Indicators
These days, there are more than 150 indicators available, and you can
even get indicators for indicators. Keep in mind that indicators are based
on five variables: the open, the high, the low, the close, and the volume
of a certain timeframe.
Indicators are simply collecting this data and displaying it differently,
and they do this by setting certain variables up in relation to others, or in
relation to previous data.
200

The Seven Mistakes of Traders and How to Avoid Them
Examples:
- Williams %R displays the high and the low to the close.
- Moving Averages display the relationship between a series of closing
prices over a period of time.
Remember, keep it simple:
One of the easiest ways to identify a trend is to use trendlines. In the sec tion “Technical Indicators,” you’ve been shown exactly how to construct
and use trendlines.
Mistake #2: Not Taking Profits
By their very nature, traders are greedy. After all, you want to make
money. A lot of money. And you want to make it fast. “Get rich quick,”
right? Every trader wants to get rich, and they want to do it in one trade.
And that’s when they lose.
Trading success comes from consistency, not from a trading “grand
slam.”
There are a lot of newbie traders out there who believe that their fortune
will be made in just one amazing trade, and then they’ll never have to
work again for their entire life.
This is a dream, a dangerous one. Successful traders will realize that
right away.
The best, and usually only, way to make a fortune in trading is consis tency. And this fortune will probably be made in small amounts. Unfor tunately, most traders go for the big wins, which result in big losses.
It makes sense that traders are more interested in larger profits per trade.
What would you rather have – a fifty dollar bill or a five dollar bill?
Well, that’s obvious! But when it comes to trading, it’s not that simple. If
201

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
you DON’T take the five dollar bill, you may lose fifty dollars of your
OWN money, or more.
The main thing to keep in mind is this: even though you can’t take the
fifty dollar bill right away, you can take ten five dollar bills over a longer
period of time. And the end result is the same – fifty dollars.
And that’s the main point here: small, steady profits add up. This is not to
say you’ll never have a big winner. In options trading for example, it’s
pretty common to have profits of 100%, 200%, or even 1,000% in just
one trade. So, it’s not impossible to snag the big profits – it’s just not
something you should count on. If you expect numbers like this all the
time and accept nothing less, you’re setting yourself up for guaranteed
disappointment.
The key to trading success: small but consistent profits. Consistency is
the key, because if your profits are consistent and predictable, then you
can simply use leverage to trade size.
Therefore, you MUST know when to exit with a profit. Resist the temp tation to stay in “just a little longer, for just a little more.”
Mistake #3: Not Limiting Your Losses
The only way you can make a fortune with trading is to actually stay in
the game, and it’s hard to stay in the game when you’ve already lost all
of your dough.
Losses are a part of our business. The key to trading success is to limit
your losses. Too many traders are giving a trade way too much “room,”
and they’re taking big hits, which can shrink an account down by 20%,
30%, and sometimes even 40%. Set small losses.
As outlined in the chapter “Is It Really Possible to Make a Living As a
Day Trader?”, your average loss should be smaller than your average
win, because then you’ll be making profits even if your winning percent age is only 50%.
Always know when to exit a trade.
202

The Seven Mistakes of Traders and How to Avoid Them
Mistake #4: Trading the Wrong Market
Too many traders are fixed on only one market; they trade ONLY the
forex USD/EUR, or the E-mini Russell, or the E-mini DOW, or just cer tain stocks, etc.
Here’s another key to trading success: trade a market that is MOVING,
either up or down. You know you should buy when the market goes up
and sell when the market goes down.
So stay away from a market that is choppy or just moving sideways, and
start trading a market with nice trends.
Take a look at the following examples:
Example 1: Choppy Market

Choppy Market

203

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Example 2: Trending Market:

Trending Market

Stick with the trending market and you’ll find the profits you’re after.
Mistake #5: Lack of a Trading Strategy
You MUST have a solid trading strategy. Having a trading strategy is
probably the single most important thing you can do in order to succeed
with trading. Having a trading strategy means having a pre-defined set of
rules that you have developed for your day trading.
It means knowing what you’re doing instead of just gambling. Too many
people start off day trading without a strategy, which means that they’re
completely unprepared.
With a day trading strategy, you're way ahead of the crowd, and you’ve
dramatically increased your chances of making money with trading.

204

The Seven Mistakes of Traders and How to Avoid Them
Mistake #6: Not Controlling Your Emotions
What are the main emotions of traders? There are many! Here’s just a
few:


Greed – “I’m sure the market will continue rising, and I’ll make
millions!”



Fear – “Please…. I don’t want to experience another loss.”



Panic – “Oh no, the market is moving fast. Why? What should I
do? The sky is falling…!”



Indecision – “Should I enter this trade? Or should I wait? Ok,
now I’m in a trade: should I take profits? Or not yet? Hmm, the
trade goes against me: should I get out now, or should I give it a
little bit more room?”



Excitement (hopefully!) – “Hey, I made money!”

How many negative emotions are on this list? Too many!
In order to become a successful trader, you have to have control over
your emotions. The best strategies and tools are useless if you lose your
head while you’re in a trade.
The Best Tools Are Useless
I recently saw the movie “The Guardian,” with Kevin Costner and
Ashton Kutcher. It’s about the U.S. Coast Guard. Kevin Costner plays an
instructor who trains young recruits to become rescue swimmers.
One day, they have a simple exercise in the pool: one of the instructors
simulates a victim and one of the cadets has to rescue him. When the res cue swimmer approaches the drowning victim, the victim grabs the
swimmer and holds him tight, trying not to drown.

205

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The rescue swimmer panics and can’t escape the victim’s grip. And both
of them almost drown.
After the exercise, Kevin Costner’s character explains this to the cadets;
the only difference between THEM and the drowning victim out there in
the ocean is that THEY have a strategy to rescue the victim and deal with
the situation. But all of the tools and equipment that they have are abso lutely useless if they panic, or have no idea what to do.
They need to remain calm and execute their strategy.
The same is true in trading: you can have the best trading strategy, supe rior software, the fastest computer, several 21” monitors, a $1,500 ergo nomic chair, and an office with the most stunning view, but all of these
things are absolutely useless if you’re in a trade and you panic.
Remain calm, cool, and relaxed. Control your emotions – don’t let them
control you.
Mistake #7: Overtrading
Many traders think that “quantity” is better than “quality.” They believe
that if you just throw enough punches, one will eventually hit. They trade
like maniacs and make their broker rich.
Traders are overtrading for the following three reasons, and none of them
are good:
1.)

Greed
You just closed a winning trade. You followed your plan and
made the profits that you were looking for. But the market keeps
going up. You think, “I should have stayed in this trade,” so you
jump right back in. And then you realize that YOU were the one
who just bought the high of the day.

206

The Seven Mistakes of Traders and How to Avoid Them
2.) Revenge
You lost money. The market has been mean to you. “They” just
took out your stop and now the market keeps moving in your di rection. So you want to get back at them. You keep trading,
thinking, “The next trade will make back all the money I lost so
far, and that will hurt them.” Believe me: the market is AL WAYS
stronger, and it will be YOU who gets the bloody nose.
3.) Boredom
There are some days when the ducks simply don’t line up.
You’re watching the markets and it’s like watching paint dry:
nothing moves. You wait…and wait…and wait…and suddenly
you just get that “itch” to trade. You think, “If I don’t trade, I
won’t make any money!” and you jump into a trade immedi ately.
Of course, the trade isn’t according to your plan, and you end up
with a loss.
I haves some news for you: if you don’t trade when there’s
nothing to trade, then you won’t lose any money – guaranteed!
If you want to succeed in trading, then you must understand the
concept of taking only the “high-probability trades.” Less is
more.
Follow your plan!

207

The Trader’s Psyche

Y

ou know that you need a strategy. And you know that there’s
more to trading than just having a strategy. In the previous
chapter, you learned about the major mistakes that traders make,
and you learned that your biggest enemy is not another trader, or market
makers, or your broker – it’s YOU.
And YOU are your biggest enemy because of your emotions.
In this chapter, you’ll learn about the mindset and psyche of successful
traders. Having a profitable trading strategy AND the right mindset will
catapult you right into the 11.5% of successful traders we talked about
earlier.
In order to develop the right mindset, you need to know what to expect
when day trading.
Many traders mistakenly believe that trading will result in a consistentlyrising account balance, like having an ATM in their front yard.
But you already know that losses are a part of our business as traders.
There will be some days and weeks when your trading exceeds your ex pectations, and there will be periods when your trading results are far
worse than you expected.
It’s essential that you maintain a long-term perspective.
Day trading means playing a numbers game. You already know that you
need to place at least 40 trades before you can look at the performance of
the strategy. Most traders only evaluate their performance once a month,
208

The Trader’s Psyche
trying to have as many profitable months as possible. Hedge funds
evaluate their performances quarterly or yearly.
Long-term evaluations have their place, but if you look at your trading
results daily, it will drive you crazy. That’s why we define weekly goals.
Sure, nobody likes going through a drawdown. But when you’re trading,
it’s inevitable. The key is in how you deal with it.
In an interview with Jack D. Schwager for his book, Market Wizards:
Interviews With Top Traders , the famous Richard Dennis said:
"It is totally counterproductive to get wrapped up in the results.
You have to maintain your perspective. Being emotionally de flated would mean lacking confidence in what I am doing. I avoid
that because I have always felt that it is misleading to focus on
short-term results."
And way too many traders focus on short-term results and lose their per spective. That's why they fail: they experience a loss or a bad week, and
so they start trading a different strategy. And while the trading strategy
they just abandoned is recovering from the drawdown, the new trading
strategy may result in yet more losses, so again, they start looking for
another.
It’s like a dog chasing too many rabbits: at the end of the day, he's totally
exhausted and he has absolutely nothing to show for it, because he didn’t
catch a single thing.
Day trading necessitates selective, wise, and patient trading methods.
Successful day traders are practical, and do not go overboard when trad ing the market. They focus on the quality of each trade, not the quantity.

209

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Here are some important characteristics of successful traders:



Successful traders do not blame. They accept the losses they
have, and they don’t dwell on them, or blame other people or
conditions. They learn from their mistakes and move on with
their trading.



Successful traders have a system. They stick to their system of
trading religiously.



Successful traders have patience. They know that most positions will not be profitable the minute they are opened.



Successful traders do not overtrade. They realize that overtrading puts their account at risk, and they know that not every
day is a day for trading. They wait for high probability oppor tunities.



Successful traders realize that nothing is 100% foolproof.
They trust in their indicators, but they are aware of other fac tors that may influence their trades.



Successful traders do not stay in a losing trade. They honor
the stop losses that they set, and they do not hold their position
in the hopes that the market will eventually “go their way.”



Successful traders do not rush into trades. They take their
time while selecting trades, and they are picky about which
trades to jump on. They don’t place orders just for the sake of
having a position in the market every second.



Successful traders stick to a successful strategy. They have
one to three techniques that really work, and they use them
over, and over, and over again.



Successful traders have the ability to adapt. They adjust their
trading methods and decisions to changing market condi tions.

210

The Trader’s Psyche



Successful traders know what type of trader they are. They
don’t force themselves to trade with methods or strategies that
do not fit their personality.



Successful traders bank on consistent profits. They know that
ignoring the small-profit trades and angling for a “grand slam”
is a sure way to lose money.



Successful traders take action. They don’t let their fear control
their decisions or interfere with their trading.



Successful traders use successful systems. Their trading methods and indicators focus on high probability trades, sound
money management, keeping their strategies free of curve-fit ting, and working their system into their business plans for
successful implementation.



Successful traders recognize a “good” trade. They don’t base
their evaluation on profits or losses; they base it on whether or
not they followed their trading plan to the letter. Even if they
DID lose money, as long as they stuck to their plan, it is a
“good” trade.



Successful traders take time off. They realize the importance of
taking breaks from trading and the markets to clear their heads.



Successful traders do not fear losses. They realize that losses
are a part of their business, and they expect them.

If you can adopt the right psychological mindset, then you’ll gain a sig nificant edge in the market.
I can’t stress this enough:
The right mindset is one of the keys to investment success, and most
traders fail to understand this.

211

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Greed and Fear
When day trading, two emotions are constantly present: greed and fear. If
your trade goes well, your natural inclination will be to trade even more,
opening yourself up to significant loss. And if your trade goes wrong,
fear will torture you. Fear of loss or fear of a further loss makes traders
scared.
Greed and fear are destructive emotions, and all traders are influenced by
them; they’re a natural part of every trader’s psychology. Greed and fear
can make traders act irrationally: they may know what they should do,
but they simply can’t do it.
The bottom line: if you’re scared or greedy, and you can’t control your
emotions when day trading, then you’ll have a very difficult time being
profitable.
But, when you trade well, in accordance with your trading plan, you will
have a fantastic chance of success. Feel proud of yourself for good trades
and decisions, but don’t dwell on them, or allow arrogance to set in.
Keep your head up and continue to apply a sound trading strategy, even
when you suffer losses – remember, they are just a part of the business.
Do not allow yourself to get caught up in positive or negative emotions –
understand the psychology behind trading and know that no trade is
guaranteed.
Work on your mental state. If a trade goes wrong, try and work out why
it did, and learn from it. Executing a trading method with discipline is the
only way to overcome destructive emotions. Whether you’re a day trader
or an investor, and whether you trade in commodities, stocks, or curren cies, the fact is that your trading psychology WILL influence your re sults.
You should never trade without a solid reason. Don’t chase the market. If
a market moves sharply, but you don’t participate in this move because
your entry criteria weren’t met, don’t worry about it. If you miss a trade,
another one will be just around the corner. Practice patience and disci pline.

212

The Trader’s Psyche
You need to control your emotions by having a specific plan to follow.
Having the correct trading psychology is just as important as having a
reliable trading strategy.
The more you are prepared mentally for trading, the better you will trade.
Note my emphasis on better trading, not better winning. A good day in
day trading is not defined by profits. Successful day traders define a
good day as one that is researched and planned and follows their overall
trading strategy.
Action Items:
 The “Law of Attraction” says that “you get what you think
about.” Here’s how to avoid negative emotions and to have a
positive attitude:
Write down 10 “I Am” statements. These statements should re flect who you WANT to be, not necessarily who you are now.
Here are some examples of “I Am” statements:
o
o
o
o

I am a disciplined trader who follows his trading plan.
I am cool and relaxed when I am trading.
I am in control of my emotions.
I am a profitable trader.

 Read these “I Am” statements every morning before you start
trading. Read them aloud and read them like you mean it. Do it
for two weeks, and I promise, you WILL notice a difference.

213

The Three “Secrets” to
Day Trading Success

T

rading can be simple, but it’s not easy. And trading is definitely
more difficult if you complicate it. Remember the saying: “ A
Confused Mind Takes No Action .” As a trader, you MUST take
action, every single day; therefore, you must avoid confusion.
So keep it simple. Very simple.
Here are the three “Secrets” to Day Trading Success



Secret 1: Trading In the Right Direction
You must buy when the market is going up and sell when the
market is going down. That’s how money is made.



Secret 2: Always Know When To Exit A Trade
It is essential that you know when it’s the right time to exit with
a profit AND when it’s the right time to exit with a loss.



Secret 3: Trade the Right Market
The right market is a trending market. As you know, money is
made in trends – either up or down – so you dramatically in crease your chances of making money if you trade a trending
market.

214

The Three “Secrets” to Day Trading Success
Now you know why I put the word “secrets” in quotation marks. These
are not “secrets” at all. Unfortunately, though, most traders don’t realize
the importance of these facts and tend to forget them.
Losing traders focus on finding a “magic method” of trading, visiting
countless websites and spending hundreds and thousands of dollars on
books, courses, and software packages.
Don’t make the same mistake. Keep your trading simple.
Remember, the “secrets” to day trading success are universal. They apply
to every market, whether you’re trading stocks, futures, options, or forex.
And they apply to every timeframe, which is why they’re so powerful.
Focus on the “secrets:”
1.) Learn how to determine whether the market is going up or going
down.
2.) Learn when to exit a trade, when to take a profit, and when to
bail if the market is not moving in your favor.
3.) And learn how to find the right market.
Don’t make your trading overly complicated. Stick to the basics. As
you already know, if you can’t drive a Ford, you won’t be able to
drive a Ferrari. And if you can’t drive a car at 10mph, you shouldn’t
try to drive it at 80mph.
Remember Power Principle #1: Use Few Rules – Make It Easy to Under stand (page 192). That’s how your trading plan should be.

215

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Action Items:
 Take a look at your trading plan right now and answer the
following questions:
o

Have you found an easy way to identify the direction of
the market?

o

What tools or indicators are you using?

o

Are you using more than two indicators? Are they com plementing each other or contradicting each other?

o

Can you describe your entry rules in two lines or less?

o

Do you know exactly when to exit a trade?

o

Do you know when to exit a trade even before you enter
it?

o

Are you sure you’re trading the right market? Did you
select a market based on your goals or based on a
“friend’s” recommendation?

o

Did you evaluate other markets to see if there’s an
alternative market which may support your goals and
your trading strategy BETTER than the one you're trad ing now?

216

The Tenets of Day Trading

T

hroughout the course of this book, you’ve learned a lot, and you
should be well on your way to becoming a successful day trader.
In this chapter, you’ll find a summary of the most important
tenets of trading success.
Online day trading requires both patience and practicality. To be success ful, you need to focus on your trading technique, not the frequency of
your trades. Remember, quality over quantity! There are many factors
that play a vital role in online trading.
First, people don’t begin with specific objectives. Most people approach
the markets and they don’t have a clue what they’re trying to do. The
first rule is to decide what you’re trying to accomplish. That’s your busi ness plan.
Take a look at the following – my list of basic tenets for day trading.
1.) Understand the Risk
The online trading market can be volatile, which creates risk. To
be successful, you must be aware of factors that can influence
prices, such as economic releases, earning reports, and state ments by government officials.

217

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
Staying updated with new developments will allow you to make
sounder trading decisions.
2.) Choose a Trading Time
Before entering the online trading market, be sure to choose a
block of time that suits your lifestyle. There is no point in trying
to trade if you can’t find a suitable time to do it.
Everyone has commitments in their lives which cannot be ig nored, so you have to decide for yourself which regularly sched uled block of time you are most comfortable with.
3.) Develop a Strategy For Your Day Trading
Every online day trader should have an online trading strategy
which he follows religiously. Most of these strategies will have
common elements, including guidelines for signals, indicators,
and rules regarding entry and exit. It’s important to determine
your strategy before you begin to trade.
4.) Trade the Right Market
Different markets have different trading profiles, which vary in
volatility (the online currency market is considered the most
volatile of them all). Some are ideal for intraday trading while
others are favorable for long-term action.
Determine the market you want to invest in based on factors
such as your account size, trading timeframe, personal knowledge, and risk tolerance.
5.) Be Open to Learning
If you’re a first-time day trader in the market, there are a number
of risk-free ways for you to gain experience. For example, with a
demo account, you can practice your order execution and trading
systems to check their viability before putting your actual money
at stake.

218

The Tenets of Day Trading
Take advantage of the ample resources available to learn and
practice the craft of online day trading.
6.) Don't Trade Too Often
Overtrading is one of the most common mistakes of traders. It
occurs mainly when traders try to compensate for their previous
losses with ‘just a few more trades.’
Wise traders will allow themselves a pause from trading activity
after a loss, instead of trading frantically in an attempt to recoup
their money.
7.) Start Small
Starting small is a wise choice, especially if you’re fairly new to
online day trading. Being conservative in your trading decisions
will help protect you from possible mistakes and failures. Re member, if you trade big, you’re risking big money and setting
yourself up for big failure.
Also, consider a few of these effective day trading strategies to stick to:


Believe in the day trading system you follow. Do not question
the effectiveness of its rules and methods unless, and until, you
have successfully explored all of its trading options.



Trade only twice a day – once in the morning and once in the
afternoon. Continue trading this way for at least the first 2 to 3
months. A conservative schedule will save you from the tempta tion of overtrading.



Make a weekly goal of $250 or $300 profit per contract.
When you get a successful trade and achieve the weekly target of
$250 or more, you should switch off your trading screen and take
a break until the following Monday. This will be good for your
health – and it’ll also help prevent overtrading. Trust me, when
the discipline you have practiced with a small weekly goal is ap plied to a larger weekly goal (where you will be trading 10-20

219

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
contracts), you’ll be very glad that you took the time to focus on
the smaller goal first.
If, for some reason, you’re not able to meet your set profit goal in a par ticular week, don’t worry. It’s happened to everyone. Just focus on con sistency in your trading results and you WILL find success.

Without Risking a Single
Penny

T

hat’s it! Now you KNOW what to do. The next step is putting it
into practice.

If you completed the action items at the end of each chapter, you now
have a trading strategy. You have tested it against the power principles.
You back-tested it, and everything looks good. You have prepared your self for the mental challenges of trading.
In short: you are ready.
Now, you NEED to begin trading. It's time for the rubber to meet the
road!
You can have the best trading plan ever, but you'll never make any
money if you don't take action and actually start. Of course, it always
helps to have a little risk-free practice first, right?
After all, you might still be pretty new to trading, even after having read
this book and completing the action items. You don't want to lose thou sands of dollars because you made a small mistake in your trading plan,
do you?
But how can you get started without risking a single penny of your own
money?
221

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
The best thing you can do is to get a "paper trading ac count." And the
best news you’ll hear today: you can get a paper trading account for
FREE from your broker. Or, just contact Rockwell Trading®, and we’ll
get you set up with a free paper trading account our selves.
So what is a paper trading account?
A paper trading account let's you trade your strategy with "virtual
money." You will get live quotes, and you can enter the trades according
to your plan. The system will simulate fills, and you'll find yourself in a
trading position. Paper trading accounts show the profit and loss in realtime, and you can see LIVE how much money you are making or losing.
Keep in mind that we're talking about "virtual money," so you are not
actually making money yet.
If you’re serious about your trading success, you MUST trade your strat egy on a paper trading account first.
Here’s why:
The biggest enemy of a trader is discipline. Traders lose money because
of a lack of discipline. Your trading plan might be excellent, but if you
don't have the discipline to follow it, then you're doomed. Trading your
strategy on a paper trading account will help you to gain confidence in
your strategy AND develop the much-needed discipline to actually make
money with it.
An Example for Trading the E-mini S&P:
Your system establishes a long position at 1190.00, and the profit target
order was placed at 1192.25 ($112.50 profit per contract). Prices move
up to 1192.00 and then reverse. One hour later, the system tries to re verse
at 1191.00. Again, prices move up to 1190.75 and reverse. Two times,
the system missed the profit target by one tick.
Should you change the strategy?

222

How to Start Trading Without Risking a Single Penny
Or should you manually override the strategy when something like this
happens?
Doing any of this is like opening Pandora’s Box. Let's say you start by
lowering your profit goal one tick. Of course, you would be instantly re warded, because the number of winners would increase.
Next week, though, you might experience the following situation: your
stop is hit and you are taken out of the trade, but then the market turns
and takes off and you are missing a nice winner. What now? Well, you
start moving your stop a little bit further away, and again, you’re in stantly rewarded: the number of losses decrease.
One week later, you experience a similar situation and you continue
"fine-tuning" your system by slightly moving down your profit goal and
minimally increasing your stop loss. And very soon, the winning system
that you once had turns into a losing one, because your losses are much
bigger than your profits.
I’ve seen it so many times: a trader will back-test his system with over
700 or maybe even 1,000 trades, and then he "fine-tunes" it after the first
5 trades. This doesn't make sense! If you have a sound logic to why your
system should work, then you shouldn’t "fine-tune" it after just 5 trades.
It doesn’t NEED fine-tuning.
You should evaluate your system periodically, but instead of curve-fitting
your system's parameters, you should ask yourself: "Does the logic of the
system still apply?"
If you have a trend-following strategy and markets are trading sideways,
then "optimizing" the strategy parameters won't even help – it's the
wrong market condition, and the market is just not right for your strat egy.
So, again, exercise discipline: if your strategy worked well for over 1,000
trades, and you have sound logic, and you haven't curve-fitted the strat egy, then you should not override the plan or "fine-tune" it after only a
few trades!

223

The Complete Guide to Day Trading
By watching your trades on a paper trading account, you’ll learn a lot
about yourself and how to deal with emotions.



Can you "pull the trigger" when your entry signal appears?



How do you feel when you see the trade moving against you? Do
you feel the urge to move your stop loss?



How do you feel when the trade makes a profit? Do you want to
get out? Or do you want to stay in a little bit longer?



Do you have the discipline to trade your system according to
your rules?

Trading a system on a paper trading account will also help you:





Watch yourself and your feelings.
Deal with your feelings.
Develop the discipline you need to become a successful trader.

And, of course, it’ll help you test your trading system under "realistic"
market conditions.
By utilizing a paper trading account to test your strategy BEFORE you
begin live trading, you will gain confidence in your strategy and your
decisions as a trader.
And confidence is your most important characteristic.
Trade your strategy for at least 40 trades on a paper trading account be fore you even think about putting real money on the line.
Stick to the successful things you know, follow your plan, and control
your emotions.
All the best in your trading!

side, and then working those odds. Short-term trading is how most trad ers and would-be traders play the markets. While it offers the greatest
financial payoffs, it also presents the greatest challenge, requiring con stant attention and vigilance, as well as a very strict plan. This book pro vides the blueprint necessary for sound and profitable short-term trading,
highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of what can be a fruitful,

Appendix E – Glossary

(Thanks to www.traderslog.com for glossary definitions)

Average True Range (ATR) – A volatility measurement indicator
developed by Welles Wilder. True Range is defined as the largest differ ence of:
- The current high minus the current low
- The absolute value of the current high minus the previous close
- The absolute value of the current low minus the previous close
Back-Testing – A method commonly used in developing a trading sys tem. A trading strategy is tested and optimized based on historical data. It
is then applied to current data to determine predictive value. Back-testing
is based on the notion that a strategy that worked in the past will continue
to work in the future.
Bear Market – A market in which prices generally decline over a period
of months or years. Sellers are often referred to as ‘bears.’ A bear market
is the opposite of a bull market.
Bollinger Bands – An indicator developed by John Bollinger which con sists of a moving average and two standard deviations, one above the
moving average and one below.

About Markus Heitkoetter

As CEO of Rockwell Trading®, Markus Heitkoetter has taught hundreds
of investors how to make consistent profits in the U.S. and European
markets.
Markus started trading 19 years ago, using point and figure charts from
published numbers in the morning newspaper, mainly with stocks. In
1996, he began developing a number of trading systems by using Super Charts (which is now TradeStation), MetaStock, OmniTrader, and other
software.
In 2002, Markus decided to quit his regular day job as a director at IBM
to become a professional trader. He moved from Germany to the United
States to get started.
Throughout his career, Markus has traded EVERYTHING: stocks, op tions, futures, commodities, spreads, forex, foreign markets, interest
rates, etc. If it’s out there, he’s probably traded it. In addition, he’s traded
on a wide variety of different timeframes: ticks, 1-, 3-, and 5-minute,
hourly, daily, and weekly.
In 2005, Markus launched Rockwell Trading® to fill the void of quality
education that he saw in the trading industry. He has since coached hun dreds of traders and investors to success through his strategies and meth ods.

Coaching Programs

Success in anything is based on instruction, practice, and guidance.
Trading is no different. Simply learning something from a seminar or a
textbook is not enough. And it’s not smart to dive in head-first without
practice either. It’s important to take the time and make sure your educa tion covers all the essentials.
At Rockwell Trading®, we offer education programs for both day traders
and investors, and our courses are based on the three key principles
above.
Rest assured that when you sign up with Rockwell, you're not getting a
run-of-the-mill trading course. You're getting something special. Our
personalized coaching is what sets us apart from our competitors.
It doesn't matter how skilled, or unskilled, of a trader you are - a coach is
essential to your success. Think about it. All of the best professionals out
there have coaches, regardless of their innate talents.
Look at Tiger Woods. He's a phenomenal golfer, a real natural. But he's
still got a coach. And do you remember what happened to Tiger Woods
when he fired his coaches? It wasn't pretty. Everyone needs guidance and
constructive criticism to be successful. Even the athletes, geniuses, and
superstars.
The same applies for all of us traders.
